That bird was probably thinking "Fuck, is *that* what I sound like? My voice sounds so weird....where the hell is the volume button on this thing..." 
-----
*OMG DELETE THAT*
-----
I love how he goes for the power cord at first, but changes his mind. Like, "That's not good enough. He needs to suffer."

lmao I had a Quaker parrot for a few years. And the moment I played this clip and saw the keyboard. I said RIP keyboard.  Birds love ripping keys out.

Such an asshole

Original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO0vPzkkZag

"I'm off key? I'll show you off key, mate!!"
-----
That look when he first hears it. "This better not be what I think it is" 

Walks over. It's exactly what he thinks it is. Cue keyboard eating induced rage. 
-----
That bird need some anger management! 

- I will destroy your power cable man, stop!
- nevermind... it has batteries
- Fuck this button

And now we come to the truth of it: This has been a long con by the apple marketing team.

My Cockatiel generally responds to videos of other Cockatiels by simply screaming the house down.

So it's natural to absolute hate one's own voice when you hear a recording of it

Wtf!!! Poor innocent escape key :/

This beats any video the Fine Bros have ever made.

-----
I love cockatiels, but man did mine destroy a lot of keyboards. To me it almost seems they like anything rectangular like that. One time when my family was playing Scrabble, our cockatiel walked up to the board, stole a tile, and threw it over the side of the table. We think he did it just because he liked watching things fall to the ground.
-----
[No escape!](https://imgur.com/a/tq8Pb)

Smart guy! I hope it has a freind bird and doesn't need to talk to your phone only.

HE'S SUCH A F*CKING SAVAGE! HE EVEN REMOVED YOU ESCAPE OPTION!

He hated the sound of his own voice so he just had to escape
-----
"Turn that off, I look so fat in that video."

I have a Microsoft ergonomic keyboard 4000...my 'tiel loves to land on it and rip off the calculator button and take off

my cockatiel  Elvis used to impersonate the microwave. I frequently cooked the same thing, so the beeps were always the same. 

So whenever the microwave door opened, he would whistle the same pattern even before I keyed it in.

Clearly this bird hates the escape key as much as Apple did...

Why does this link have twice as many upvotes as the youtube vid has views?

That's a cockatiel, correct? I'm pondering maybe getting one but not sure if it fits into my life, though I might try to make room. I have a middle aged cat I am pretty sure would be chill with it supervised.
-----
I knew I recognized this bird!  I first saw it on a vine from a few years ago, doing the ringtone and walking around some table legs.

'WHO THE FUCK IS THAT BITCH I'LL FUCK THEM UP AND EAT THIS MACHINE WHILE I'M AT IT!' Said the bird (probably).

That's my "hidden" section. We may be redditing wrong. Though I really don't see the point of hiding things when it just makes you more likely to see it later by storing it under that tab for you... Or why anyone even feels the need to hide things.

I would be surprised if it were more than just scratchy demos and studio warmups. 
-----
If Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Robert Plant toured again I think I'd fly to go see them. It's a bucket list type show for me so hopefully they'll decide to make a fuck ton of money one last time.
-----
Never heard of this band, I'll probably check them out
-----
So there will be a new Zep "album" before Tool.
-----
Sweet baby Jesus, my body is ready. 
-----
The last time Jimmy Page waited this long to release something it was Lori Maddox. 
-----
One of things I love about Rush is that they say there is no 'unreleased material'.  They put it all on record.  These types of releases are rarely worth the wait.  Common sense dictates that the best songs end up on the record.
-----
I wonder who the inspiration was for this new stuff.
-----
Oh no, is Robert Plant ok?
-----
I'm all boned up over here. 
-----
Ahh, they'll go over like a lead balloon
-----
It's fucking weird led zepplin is still alive 
-----
It's time he acknowledges all those bootlegs. To me Led Zeppelin is the best live band. The way they jammed, improvised and played tribute to random artists without breaking stride really displayed their love for performing. Even early in their career they were doing sets twice as long as normal groups, and when they really hit it big most of their shows were three hours long! And they did that multiple times a week for months at a time! 

There are many scratchy bootlegs, but there are actually some soundboards out there. Each recording is different in their unique way. 
-----
IB4 they still only play the same 4 Zep songs over and over on the radio.
-----
Im guessing it's material recorded in 1968 or 69 and they are getting it out in order to keep it copyrighted under the "use it (within 50 years) or lose it" rule. But sure, tying it in with their 50th anniversary makes for a good excuse too.
-----
Been a while since I got the Led out
-----
Would be hilarious if it turns out to be more stolen material. 
-----
**I *hate* Jimmy Page**

-Mindless Self Indulgence 
-----
One summer when I was 16 my dad caught me smoking pot.  I was a dead man, I thought, for sure.  My Dad took me out to the shed, sat me down, and reached up under his workbench.  Don't get me wrong, my Dads a good and kind man, but he was also firm and he wouldn't hesitate to use the belt when I had fucked up big time.  This time I had fucked up double big time.

Seeing my dad roll a joint for the first time was weird, like walking in on a perfect-celebrity-someone taking a shit and realizing that they are just human too.  We smoked a little, talked and he put on a tape, fast-worded and rewound a bit to get to the right spot, and cranked it up.

Hearing "[When the Levee Breaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwiTs60VoTM)" for the first time rewired my brain.  It changed everything about me.  I had never heard anything like that; and honestly didn't think music could sound "wet".  Not wet like washed with effects but like wet and sweaty.  This song sounds like the southern heat feels.  That day I became a die hard Zep fan and, to this very day nearly a decade and a half later, they are still my all time favorite band.

Hearing anything new from them would be a blessing and I very much look forward to this.
-----
What's that? A reason to live? Ok darkness, not today. Not today. 
-----
Anyone get the feeling the marketing teams at Bethesda and Warner Brothers music are fucking like sheep? Hopefully we'll soon have Skyrim: Kashmir Edition.
-----
Has he let that 14 year old go yet? 

-----
I hope we finally get to hear Hotdog: Part II
-----
Probably from when they went through their rap/rock phase.
-----
Having nothing to do with crappy new releases:

I randomly put on Zep I last night in furtherance of the education of my kids. And today I say, get ye to the headphones and listen to Good Times Bad Times and consider it was the first song on the first Zep album and there had never been anything like it before. Dig the power chords. Dig the badass MFin big balls bass line. Dig when Page rips off those fills that are still unbelievable today. 

I look forward to the inevitable eventual pop culture re-discovery of Led Zeppelin and 70's rock. That band is MFin unmatched. There's nothing like Led Zeppelin. 

But I'm not fired up for some crappy stuff that waited 50 years in a drawer because its crappy.
-----
Gonna get a new led yepplin album but still cant get tool to finish up on theirs. 
-----
i'm only interested in it if it contains new songs that they never released. Not out takes of existing songs and not live recordings. That's been played out too much. I know they have got to have songs they didn't release for whatever reason.
-----
Just imagine if it was an album of ten songs that previously went unreleased because they were so good they were worried it might destroy the Earth.
-----
I was not aware Jimmy Page was Native American.
-----
Does he know that Greta Van Fleet already released it? 
-----
I'd kill somemone to be able to watch a Zep reunion with Jason Bonham on drums, and all they do is come out and play Dark Side Of The Moon from start to finish.
-----
Holy shit! Holy shit! Yes yes 
-----
I'm sure they saved the best for last.s/
-----
Got to get that PR up before the sex scandal bombs drop. 
-----
How about he release that 14 year old girl?
-----
This is a living reflection of a dream! 
-----
If I were a famous man who everyone knows used to fuck teenagers, I probably wouldn't release anything right now
-----
They've already released so much previous material it's probably Robert Plant gargling while Page tunes his guitar.
-----
Turns out it's just Despascito.
-----
Or a 14 hour long Bonham drum solo.
-----
After this last batch of remasters and out-takes he said that that was it. There was nothing else to make a project out of. Guess not! 
-----
In this version, we put Bonzo's pedal squeak high up in the mix. 
-----
It's just Jimmy Page looking for his needle and spoon
-----
I always have that same thought when a band which hasn't been around for years suddenly has new material. There's probably a reason it was never realeased on one of their albums. 
-----
Really? , isnt Jimmy Paige the most recorded musician of all time studio wise?

Wasnt Led Zeppelin arguably the most prolific band to exist?


I know they ended abruptly with the passing of Bonham but is it really that big of a stretch?

-----
Pretty sure Plant will absolutely not do it. I recall him saying that aside from the fact it is better to let the band stand on its history, he can't sing those songs anymore, his voice doesn't have the range.  He killed his voice with smoking and other bad decisions such as not warming up before shows. 
-----
I just want a new Them Crooked Vultures album.
-----
Saw Robert Plant and the Sensational Shapeshifter's at Bonnaroo a few years back. While I do not listen to his new stuff too often, I cried tears of joy when they played The Wanton Song, Black Dog, Dazed and Confused, and Whole Lotta Love. Was probably the only time I will ever get to hear a snippet of one of greatest bands ever.
-----
Fingers crossed for Desert Trip.  The first weekend of the last one was one of the highlights of my life.  I would make the long trip from London again if it happens and pay whatever it cost to be in the pit.
-----
Our last shot was after the O2 reunion show in '07.  Plant was on board at one point, but then backed out.  The rest of the boys went on to practice with a few singers, but never put anything together, and the effort feel apart.  I've always felt they should have formed a new band without Plant, don't call it Zeppelin anything, and just make some good music.  For whatever reason, it just didn't happen.
-----
Does anyone almost feel like that band is a little *too* on the nose? It's almost as is they are a zeppelin tribute band playing original music, the style is that similar!

It's stupendous music, but it's almost a little uncanny how on the nose it is. It will be interesting to see where they go in a few albums and what they evolve into. I don't think they could make a handful of albums in the same vein; even zeppelin was half acoustic by the third record (GvF was half acoustic on their first EP...) 
-----
Absolutely. Tell me this does not sound like an unreleased song off of Zep II:  https://youtu.be/HxbT5jSxGJ0
-----
Never heard of them until now. Just listened to them and holy shit the similarity in style and vocals is uncanny! 
-----
So nice, so fine. All mine.
-----
Lol, came to make a similar comment. 

Loving GVF right now. 
-----
Before that, they were Kingdom Come.
-----
Makes even more sense when you watch the music videos. No way that voice comes out of that dude.
-----
They try too hard to sound exactly like Led Zep. I personally don't get the love for them. Like everything about them is exactly Led Zep, from production to tone. Seems like a tribute band that changed the words to the songs and released it as all new original music.
-----
So these guys are this year's Wolfmother I guess? I feel like we get one of these Led Zeppelin cover bands once every few years that has a hit and then disappears once the novelty wears off.
-----
Mind Blown. Thank you! Never heard of them until this post. GVF is awesome!
-----
Ha!
-----
Fucking hell you are spot on.  
-----
"what year is it?" 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKDvJTxZDbA
-----
Don't disrespect Zeppelin like that. Those kids aren't nearly as good as Zeppelin was/is.
-----
I think the problem is their lead singer sounds like a Robert Plant clone more than anything. That's his voice though... 
-----
Sounded even better when they were Rival Sons
-----
Saw them live last night.  They're going to be huge.
-----
They're still pretty underground 
-----
Phases of every Zep fan:

1. Stairway to Heavan

2. Kashmir 

3. When the Levee Breaks

4. No Quarter

5. Achilles Last Stand

EDIT: 6. Ten Years Gone
-----
There will probably be a new Hendrix album before Tool. *sigh*
-----
Noone ever said Tool was making more music. 
-----
I've learned that when a famous artist releases work that was previously unreleased, there's a reason it wasn't released.
-----
If we can't get a tour this is the next best thing. I  wonder what year the recordings are from
-----
The "If It Keeps On Raining" version of when the levee breaks was a good version. Boomy bass. The rough version of Moby Dick on Led Zepellin II was also great.
-----
Sad but true.. let it lie I say! Let it lie
-----
My dad will still buy it all =[
-----
A lot of the deluxe edition bonus tracks were pretty disposable. I liked "10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod (Pod)" from *Presence*, and the "Royal Orleans" reference mix had some amusingly goofy vocals. but for most of the catalog, there wasn't much revelatory. I like having the rough mix from "Ramble On" on *Led Zeppelin II* because (with some volume cranking) you can hear the uncut fadeout until the band actually stops, meaning a few more seconds of John Paul Jones' great bass fills. But the unreleased track "La La" is pretty lame, and stuff like "Moby Dick" minus the drum solo is really only interesting if you care to hear how they spliced it. Besides EQ, I struggle to hear any differences between "Driving Through Kashmir" and the finished track on *Physical Graffiti*. The live concert included with the first album is probably the most revisitable.  

tl;dr: Either the bottom of the barrel has already been scraped pretty clean, or if there is good unreleased stuff, I'm wondering why we didn't get it with the last reissue campaign. 
-----
It was a minor incident
-----
Bahaha!
-----
It depends on the band imo. Plenty of bands go into the studio with 15 tracks ready but only release 12 of them.
-----
You realize Physical Graffiti, arguably their best album, was like half outtakes from past albums, right?
-----
The Hobbit trilogy
-----
 Thor 3, millennials, bandwagons, cookie cutter corporate bullshit, and above all else MONEY. I heard they are collaborating with 21 Pilots and Imagine Dragons for the soundtrack to Suicide Squad 2 and even though the song hasnt been released, it is number 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the "Rock" charts.

They're putting him down next week. Keeps peeing on the rug.
-----
Saw him the other week at the Royal Albert Hall. He's doing fine, I did think Jimmy looked a bit strung out though.
-----
Starting to swell up
-----
No one take it if this guys offers you a drink.
-----
Bonham is dead. Never forget Bonham.
-----
> zepplin 


-----
Which ones Led?
-----
Collected many soundboards, wish Jimmy would follow the Dead in finding someone to oversee releasing some
-----
I preferred their live performances but you have to admit that page was a bit sloppy at times. Live Aid 85 was a example of this. 
-----
The what rule?  Isn't current copyright "death plus 70 years?"  If Jimmy Page drops dead today material for which he has songwriting credits would enter the public domain in 2087...
-----
I like how your dad thinks.  Taking notes for when my kids turn 16.
-----
Remind me! Check on this person after the sure to be disappointing album comes out.
-----
What the hell does that have to do with this? 
-----
I swear for every thread involving some celebrity there's this one guy who thinks it's awfully topical to mention some kind of random shit he did like half a century ago. Then again, okay, I guess it's pretty topical these days.
-----
he let her go years ago! once she became 18 her novelty died to him
-----
I'm alright with it


-----
Its Robert Plant yodeling "ooooh yeah" and describing airplanes flying overhead for about 100 minutes.
-----
Reminds me of the time Radiohead just tuned their instruments on stage at Glastonbury(?) for 4 minutes and the crowd cheered afterwards thinking it was a "bold" new track
-----
Lol!  I could care less really.  This should not even be news. :)
-----
I would listen to a Led Zeppelin cover of Despascito. 
-----
I would honestly love that.
-----
Was there crack back then?
-----
So you're saying Since I've Been Loving You is all squeak now?  
-----
Plant turned down nearly a billion dollars for a reunion tour.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/10/showbiz/music/robert-plant-turns-down-zeppelin-reunion-800-million/index.html
-----
You don't have to do that to not be able to sing those songs when you're 70.
-----
I don't know... I saw him a couple years ago and I think he hit a lot of the notes just fine. I think that's a weak excuse when he's touring around playing Zep tunes anyway. If he doesn't want to do it, that's fine, but don't tell me about not hitting notes haha
-----
They wouldn't have to play their old material. If they do like Johnny Cash , they could reinterpret songs that more suit his voice. A crap voice can still sound beautiful, just look at Tom Waits. For whatever reason, when I imagine this fantasy album, it starts with 'Sunny Afternoon'.
-----
I saw him live 3 years ago and his voice is still absolutely incredible! Probably not the same range as in his prime but he's definitely still got the capacity to tour Zeppelin songs, given he usually plays half a dozen in his normal shows too
-----
I saw them and it was one of the best shows I've ever seen.
-----
I mean, Highway Tune hit #1 on iTunes and it's literally the first song they recorded (when they were 14-16). I'm not sure they expected their first four songs to be *this* popular. 

They avoid mentioning Led Zeppelin in interviews, and when I saw them live they did a crazy variety of covers. Blues, Jazz, some African music I don't know.

It's all going to rely on their first full album release. 

Edit: They released 4 songs, then a double EP with 4 more songs. These are all songs they've recorded and been playing for a year+, so I suppose I mean a full 8 song album after their initial 4.
-----
I am SO GLAD that this was the top commented conversation going on here as my feelings are the same!  I can't tell if GvF is brilliant or blatantly ripping off Led Zepplin.  I mean, I love LZ so in that way it's a win but... it just feels like a farce.
-----
Glorified cover band thing is obviously working. Just wait, were going to see a resurgance of "OMG this band I found sounds exactly like ___."
-----
I concur. That guys voice isn't going to hold up being forced like that over the course of a few albums. They do a good job of imitating the sound, but I think overall it lacks direction or creativity that Zeppelin was able to capture. Like they inputted Zeppelin II into Google's DeepDream AI, cross pollinated it with modern songwriting, and GvF was the output. I half expected Tolkien references. 

I'd be more interested in hearing something a bit more nuanced and outside the bounds of Zeppelins influence. 

Even the album cover pays homage to Rainbows Long Live Rock n Roll.

I dunno. On the one hand it's cool to hear 'that sound'...but on the other...I kinda cringe at how closely their recreating that sound. Even Page knew to change shit up if he was going to steal something.

 
-----
One time I saw a local band called citizen sage.  Their style was so like Zeppelin.  Then, finally they owned up and played a real Zeppelin song.  They were able to pull it off.
-----
I was part of the same music scene as those guys in mid-michigan, we used to call them "Led Direction", lol.
-----
Yeah when I heard it I wasn't really listening but then I was like, "Oh ok, an uncovered Zep track" but then I noticed that the production was modern. 
-----
I'm 23 and never got to live in the Zeppelin era obviously. If they want to "mimic" Zeppelin while producing good sounding music at the same time it's not gonna bother me. I'm absolutely digging them, I get that they're not a unique sound by any means, but a new take on my favorite sound of all time is what I'm all about.
-----
They aren't the first band to copy Led Zeppelin. Just look at Great White or Whitesnake. I mean, David ~~Coverversion~~ Coverdale was so desperate to be Robert Plant, he did an album with Jimmy Page. 
Edit: Great white not white lion.
-----
Yeah, they just sound like a glorified cover band who've moved on to doing new material. Like Airbourne! with ACDC. I'd be more impressed if they struck their own path rather than just ape what worked forty years ago. 
-----
Gary Moore already wrote [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0aSDFA0Vk0) about it 28 years ago.
-----
It is too close, however the dead giveaway is the drums. If you listen they sound nothi g like Bonham's.
-----
Sounds like Physical Graffiti era Zep to me. 
-----
That sounds like Led Zep with Lars on drums
-----
Many of them really do. To a degree that seems intentional bordering on cynical. It seems like a very intentional imitation and that actually turns me off just a little bit.

I bet in a few years they'll will grow into their own.
-----
Oh my god.  I wasn't ready for that level of imitation.

Haha
-----
Holy shit. 
-----
Never heard of them before this thread and holy shit that is uncanny.
-----
The vocals and guitar maybe. That drummer doesn't sound like John Bonham though.
-----
The vocals sound like Plant but the rest is more in The Black Crows territory. 
-----
Drummer plays a Ludwig 26/14/16/18..

Definitely Zep fans. 
-----
Course it's pretty much the same style - from the sound of the snare - drum fills, the vocals. The bassist isn't up to much at all though. There seems to be very few nice bass fills going on in any of their work. Every other nuance is pretty much like LZ though. A lot of their songs feel like watered down versions of 'Thank You' / 'Hey Hey What Can I Do?' 'Going To California', EG, their track 'Flower Power'  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufSj7bXnAmI  

Vocalist is very talented. He is totally taking off from all of Robert Plant's tricks, even the little 'woo yeahs'  - that level of ripping off is a tad cringey though. Yeah, it's basically like a Lidl/Aldi version of Led Zeppelin, it's pretty much the same-but it's not the very same. Ideally, you should really be trying to do something a bit different as an artist, but they are still very talented and it's a quality end product. It wouldn't be my thing to listen to, even though I listen to LZ a good bit, not as much as I did though.  

But, it doesn't really make me angry - like there's plenty of other choice out there if it grinds your gears. They are young guys and they have ability. And if it encourages young teenagers to pick up instruments and get into bands all the better.
-----
Yeah I'm just gonna assume that is Led Zeppelin
-----
I discovered them recently and it and just instantly fell in love.  I couldn't believe how young they are.  They were young teens when they formed in 2012.  
-----
Saw them live recently.

jesus fuck they are good. 
-----
[With VH, Scorpions, Dokken, and Metallica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_of_Rock_Tour_1988)
-----
It's 1988. I've just started high school and discovering hard rock and heavy metal. I'd been playing drums for about 6 months and already joined a (horrible) band. I'm standing in a Target store and in their electronics department, I see this video playing on all the TVs. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2S1JKJqXvQ
-----
I clicked on a Greta van fleet link once with no context. I just knew it was music, had no idea about the genre. The first thing I thought as the video buffered was "Huh, this guy looks like he could be Julien Baker's twin brother" and for some reason I automatically associated him with her style of music. Then he started singing and I was seriously confused for a minute. My brain couldn't make it make sense.
-----
Yeah, it's kinda Oasis-level wearing your influences on your sleeve to the point where they *are* your sleeve. 
-----
It's been like 45 years since Zeppelin started out, so there is some room for a band that has a similar style.

keep in mind Highway Tune is their first recorded song, and I don't think they intended for that to be the first impression the world gets of them. 

They commonly talk about how they all have very different tastes in music, and the only theme they share is blues. 

I'll save any "too much like zeppelin" for when they release a full album. Right now they only have 8 songs. 
-----
Obviously the vocals sound like Robert Plant but I think the rest of the band ensemble doesn't have to talent to remotely compare to Led Zeppelin. Namely the drums and guitar. I've heard some of their other music and they don't really have the variety of sound that Led Zeppelin had. It seems they're just trying to do a classic rock sound but not much else.

To me Greta Van Fleet sounds like Cage the Elephant trying to sound like Led Zeppelin. Jeff Buckley sounds genuinely more like Led Zeppelin than these guys
-----
Saying they sound just like Zeppelin should be taken as the highest of compliments. It is very similar, but they have original songs so it doesn't bother me at all. Can't fault the kid for having an incredible voice, or the band for having good taste and being influenced by one of the greatest bands of all time. 
-----
In a world with millions if musicians, I dont really care if they want to sound exactly like led zeppelin.
-----
I wanted to make this comment but didn't want to get downvoted. It is extremely lazy, a cheap imitation of Led Zeppelin if you ask me. The vocals are too similar to Robert Plant, if you are modifying your voice to sound like another artist you're no better than a cover band. 
-----
Eh I still really like Soen and they try hard to sound exactly like Tool.
-----
I have to disagree. Wolfmother definitely can sound reminiscent of Led Zeppelin, especially on their first album, but they definitely do not maintain that throughout their discography. They're a good modern rock band that has a heavy 70s influence.
-----
Wolfmother were more sabbath in parts than zep, I'd say, but you're right, they've been popping up two or three a year for the best part of two decades, not necessarily always and obviously *trying* to be Zep or Sabbath or Rose Tattoo or ACDC or whoever, but not shy about who their influences are either.


-----
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKDvJTxZDbA

I mean, Beware of Darkness kind of started out wearing Zeppelin heavily on the sleeve, but their sophmore album goes in a somewhat different direction. Good music without being as on the nose as GVF seems to be. 
-----
Just the drummer is
-----
TIL I'm not actually a Zeppelin fan...
-----
6\.  Hot Dog
-----
But in all honesty, the instrumental interlude in No Quarter is still my favorite moment in music ever. I still remember listening to that for the first time, and nothing EVER has ever touched it for me. Sent chills down my spine. 
-----
6 - Ten Years Gone
-----
 6 The Rain Song
-----
Nah, it's more like:

"Led Zeppelin III fucking blows!"

years later...

"Holy shit, Led Zep III is fucking amazing.  How did I not realize this?"
-----
6: Since I've been loving you
-----
And then back to Levee Breaks
-----
Holy shit that's a bit too accurate than I'd like to admit
-----
LOL this is so true.  Zeppelin is my favorite band, and No Quarter and Achilles Last Stand are probably my favorite Zepp songs.
-----
The Rain Song has always been my favorite Led Zep song.
-----
Tool did actually... 2018 release per danny
-----
Led Zeppelin's worst stuff will likely be better than many band's best stuff 
-----
I think Untitled Unmastered might be an exception to that  
-----
La La tho
-----
You never know...there's some pretty sweet shit that's been released by the Hendrix estate over the years.
-----
Led Zepplin is to baby boomer dudes what Beyonce is to millenial women. 
-----
He broke the g string while fingering a minor 
-----
 But if those 3 leftovers are any good they show up on the next album or a b side or some smaller release.  I don't believe any band has kept great songs unreleased.  Only exception IMO is a few Nirvana songs like You Know Youre Right.  But that band ended before its time.
-----
Some of Soundgarden's best stuff was cut out of official album releases

Black Rain, Bleed Together, Fresh Deadly Roses, etc
-----
Which validates what I said.  Those songs will end up being release on the next album it as b sides.  And with Graffiti they out those songs on there because the original material they wrote for the album was too long, so they turned it into a double album
-----
Page hopes it will sell enough to buy one Bitcoin. 
-----
Word is JPJ is driving him to the Dr appointment
-----
Girth Brooks
-----
I think I speak for all of us when I say he went out the way we all want to.
-----
Yeah losing the world's greatest drummer, and an absolutely key member of the group's sound ain't no big deal
-----
That's also weird.  Pink Floyd is alive and it seems realistic.

Zepplin?  Fucking led zepplin?  Soul of a woman was created below?!?!  Nobody that smart makes it this long.  
-----
Sloppy and self indulgent. When Zeppelin hit their groove they were untouchable, but then Jimmy would break out his theremin or Bonzo would launch into a 40 minute drum solo without sticks while Plant makes seal noises in the background.
-----
True, their last tour was messy. But the actual Led Zeppelin tours from 69 to 77 were incredible.
-----
Just because it was a couple of years doesn't mean it's okay. People shouldn't be idolising an adult man who preyed on a 14 year old. 
-----
It will be the most amazing tuning session you've ever heard. I swear man, the way Page just finds the right pitch. It's just effortless. Like he's not even trying. Or maybe using a tuner pedal actually
-----
Found the guy that bought "Coda".
-----
Wanna whole lotta extra stuff...
-----
Agreed. For a period of time they had a studio in the back of a truck following them around so they could just randomly record stuff in the woods and crap. 
-----
BBC sessions, live albums....
-----
Me too. But to be fair I'd listen to anything zeppelin
-----
Background music at work 
-----
How many more letters and notes scribbled on the back of envelopes can Christopher Tolkien package up?
-----
yep... I don't think people understand how stubborn Plant is about never going back to Zep.

I think people don't understand either that Plant was very loyal to John... John was a big support to Robert after the death of his son.  I'm sure I've seen interviews where Plant said you can't do it without John.  I doubt those reunion shows would have happened if it wasn't John's son on drums (they did do that one show with Phil Collins though, which was a disaster... Page and Plant were not on at all that show).
-----
True... but it is well documented that he fucked his vocal chords and by as early as 1972-1973 he changed how he sang many songs... particularly over the hills and far away.  By the late seventies some referred to his voice as a 'train wreck.' (edit: relative to his prime)  Which is sad because he his voice in his prime is regarded as one of the best in rock.

I think Mick Jagar has proven that it is possible to have staying power past the age of 70... yeah his voice isn't what it was either, but I doubt Plant can even tread water next to Mick these days... vocally.  
-----
I saw Plant live when he was touring with the Honey Drippers back in the eighties. He absolutely could not sing those songs anymore and has lost that range back then. I'm sure that hasn't changed in 30 years. 
-----
Bro. Bonnaroo '15 is a perfect example of keeping Zeppelin in retirement. It will never have the same swagger as it possessed in the 70's with John drumming along and bringing grooves. 

Robert Plant's set there was awful. He was one of the main headliners I was dying to see with the kind of mentaity your comment possesses. He played an all-acoustic set on a main stage surrounded by booming sound systems from other stages drowning out his barely audible folk vocals. He even did Black Dog...acoustic-folk style....

That man gave it his all back in Led's prime, but it's safe to say those days are long and gone.
-----
It isn't exclusively the reason, but is one of many that he has stated.

* No Bonham
* Let sleeping dogs lie
* The voice
* The feud

are just some of his reasons.
-----
I'm going to see Plant on his US tour in early 2018 and I'm totally stoked.  He's been consistently putting out fantastic new music the last few years.  Start with Raising Sand and work up to Carry Fire.  He's a great singer for that material.  I absolutely love Zeppelin, but I'm really glad that Plant is still pushing himself as an artist this way.
-----
What was he singing?  I never said he can't sing... he can't sing THOSE songs anymore; not the way they were recorded.

His voice going to 'shit' by the late 70's is well documented and observed (contrasted to his voice at the start of zep).
-----
I think losing Bonham had a huge impact on Plant.  I never realized this till I learned about their relationship after Plant's son died in '77.
-----
I'm in my 40's but never got to see them live.  For me... I'm kind of sad that I won't get to see the whole band walk off stage except for Bono who then goes into a 5+ minute drum solo.

And agreed... I wouldn't mind seeing them play the songs that can be done, but I still have resolved to the fact it won't happen.  I don't agree with those though that say if the stones can do it well, Zep can do it well... they forget zep has barely done it in the last 40 years minus that small tour.
-----
Caught them at a small venue in Columbus, OH. Fucking amazing.
-----
Your post made me look up Highway Tune on Spotify and I thought this song was a Zeppelin song I had never heard before when I previously heard it on the radio
-----
Black smoke rising is my favorite, although I think that song sounds the least like zeppelin. 
-----
It's like they wrote a Zeppelin fanfic and this is the audiobook. 

Admittedly, I am a Zep nerd complete with bootlegs and out of print books and interviews stored away in the garage, so I might have a bit of a bias, but I just looked up GvF and it's not anywhere close. That said, the guitarist seems to have that whole "playing messy on purpose" vibe that Page had down fairly well.
-----
Meh. If Zep had chops--which they did, of course--then it takes chops to imitate them. To my ears there's some pretty strong resemblances (which, to be honest, seem to derive just as much from the production as the playing), but they're working from a template that was already fairly long in the tooth when *Zeppelin* took their shot *fifty* years ago. So you're channeling a band who channeled other bands? At this stage in the game, my reaction is, 'so what?' They're a very young band. Now if they continue to go to the same well over and over, there's an issue. But they sound alright to me. It's a good place to start. 

There have been plenty of "poor man's (fill-in-the-band)" over the years; some make something happen and some go back to the bars or pumping gas or whatever. I'm not gonna buy their record or anything but I just don't think managing to 'sound like Zeppelin' is anything to be ashamed of. 
-----
This reminds me of Airbourne. Like, they were really just an AC/DC cover band with original music. Haven't heard them in years though, so maybe they've evolved.
-----
I think you triple posted this .
-----
Listening to the Tame Impala vocalist is like having John Lennon back, though. So I'm cool with it. 
-----
*cough cough DONALD GLOVER AND FUNKADELIC cough cough**
-----
The majority of the music that comes out nowadays sounds very very similar to many bands that have come before. I notice it the more I get older and it kinda has put me off the crate digging I used to do in my teens and early twenties. Not saying nothing original comes out, I just see a cyclical/influential trends recycle over and over. Yes, this band does sound just like Fleetwood Mac, Yes that band does sound just like VU, etc on and on.
-----
K I N G D O M C O M E
-----
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I heard some interview with them where they claimed they don't really listen to Led Zeppelin. I was like "oh okay, surrrrreee"
-----
There was a local band where I went to college that was basically Rush. When they actually covered YYZ, it blew my mind. 
-----
Ha, I'm just watching the video and can see exactly why! My arse looks more rock 'n' roll.
-----
Or Kingdom Come, that was blatant
-----
[Don't forget Kingdom Come.](https://youtu.be/7w-atB68kpI) On second thought, it's ok if you do. Everybody else has. 

They were dubbed Led Zepagain by Robert Plant himself. 
-----
I love Zeppelin. Coverdale stands on his own as a vocalist, and that early Whitesnake (before they re recorded with an American ringer band) is awesome. Guilty of Love, Slow and Easy - also Burn Deep Purple is excellent. Check it out!
-----
Agreed.  But, where Whitesnake, or Great White, obviously was going for the Zep sound GVF is spot on.  It is like a cover band, but somehow with new songs.

They have talent but like other have said they got to change their sound a little to have long term success IMHO.
-----
Are you thinking of Great White?


-----
Whitesnake sounds nothing like led zepplin
-----
I wish we could use the interrobang without someone calling attention to it every time it's used
-----
WTF, Zeppelin fan forever and my first time hearing them.  Mind fucking blown.
-----
Imagine if they got this guy and went on tour with him? Similar to what Queen+Adam Lambert are doing now.
-----
I live and breathe Zeppelin and am a guitarist who has been tone questing Pagey for literally decades. The voice is very close to Plant but is also like Geddy Lee in parts. 

I really don't think the rest of the band are in the same space other than being rocky. Production and tone are different, phrasing is different. Arrangements in some parts are similar but it's the voice here that people are latching to. 
-----
I totally agree.  I listened through this entire release and at the start I was thinking "this is *too* close to zep".  The more I listened the more I could hear some subtle differences, but it's still just so similar.  From the inflections of his voice and the way the drums were recorded- everything was very deliberately made to sound like a zeppelin record.

They're a good band, but I'm worried they won't be very sustainable.  I hope they prove me wrong.
-----
My exact opinion, why not use that voice to make something new instead of rehashing Led Zeppelin sounding tunes?
-----
Nope.  Listen to the double-album Physical Graffiti.

Also, the Crows were heavily influenced by Zepp, so there's that...


-----
It sounds like a previously unreleased Bob Plant side project with no involvement from the rest of Zeppelin.
-----
Drums sound EXACTLY like John Bonham. Exact same style, similar huge sound. 

And coming from a guy who went through a phase of trying to emulate Jimmy Page on guitar - the guitar sounds a LOT like Page style rhythms and fills. 
-----
Highway tune came up in a spotify playlist, and I thought I was hearing some LZ deep cut. then I find out it is a new band, and the songs they had on spotify were AMAZING.

I want to see them next time they come through philly, but it looks like that wont be for a while. 
-----
I just put them on for the first time and goddamn that kid has some pipes. He really does sound like a young Robert Plant.

Edit - but yeah, they really do sound like a Zep cover bad and Zoso has that covered.
-----
I've just discovered them now thanks to this thread and I absolutely love them despite the fact that I haven't finished listening to the first song.
-----
That was a great fucking concert.  
-----
lol I remember that. Poor Dokken getting booed because they followed Metallica. I believe Metallica was just about to release And Justice For All and this was the first time most people had seen them since the last tour with Cliff. 
-----
I was a few months from going to Orlando for Navy basic training when that album came out. I am a huge Zeppelin fan, and I "knew" there would be no new stuff from them ever again, so I really got into it. I played the hell out of a few cassette copies of their self-titled.

*In Your Face*... not so much.
-----
I never found Oasis to be a band that relies too much on their influences. Which influences are you talking about?
-----
On first listen (which I'm enjoying), GVF sounds significantly more derivative than most Oasis
-----
> Right now they only have 8 songs. 

Which is how many songs Zep had on their first 4 albums... for 8-tracks.
-----
> so there is some room for a band that has a similar style

Apparently you've forgetting about the 70's and 80's when every hair band tried to be Zeppelin.

Ever heard of "Aerosmith"?...
-----
Changed my initial view, actually. Thanks!
-----
That's a good point.  I made an honest run at being a musician from about 17-25 yrs old.  Even the first few albums I had written, it was blatantly obvious who I was listening to at the time.  It's very hard to hone your own unique sound.  These kids obviously have a great foundation so we'll see where it goes.  
-----
Similar. Not blatant cheap rip off. They are zep without the amazing guitar drums bass and arrangement. They should just wear wigs and go to Vegas 
-----
The problem is Page was a god level guitarist and JPJ is the forgotten one who could write like a monster. 


But they do a bit too much wannabe Zep stuff.
-----
Unless you fucking hate Led Zeppelin.
-----
If I want to listen to Led Zeppelin why not listen to the real thing? If you have that talent why not try to make something new instead of blatantly trying to sound like Led Zeppelin?

Props to them though, they're making boat loads of cash and fans for making a glorified cover band.
-----
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKDvJTxZDbA
-----
like GVF, there's just something a little off about it and doesn't have the thing they're trying to copy's "magic".  imo of course.
-----
Agree.  They are totally rock solid awesome live.  Saw them at the Showbox (Market) in Seattle a little while back.

-----
He'll get his big Levee Break! 
-----
Man the yardbirds had such potential, if only any of those guys had followed through
-----
But he wasn't dropped from the Yardbirds.  They broke up and Jimmy retained the rights to the name and started a new band call The New Yardbirds.  This name didn't stick, but Led Zeppelin did. 
-----
Too soon
-----
I shouldn't have, but I laughed.
-----
Yeah, Kashmir was never my favorite Led Zep song, does that mean I'm not a fan?
-----
Lmao
-----
AWWWWWWWWWWW HOTDOG
-----
7.) Hots on for Nowhere
-----
The live versions are god-tier when it comes to that whole interlude section

Tool also did a pretty good cover of that song

This one is my favorite.

Yeah, it's definitely one of their best and most diverse.

The version of Red House on Valleys of Neptune is definitive imo
-----
I have this album of him on an acoustic with a tape recorder in his basement. It was sold with a comic book back in 1995. I've never heard or seen it again. Luckily it still plays out of the CD player in my car. I should probably digitize it...

edit: nvm found it: https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0670867896

Too true.

Damn the accuracy in this

He kidnapped an underage girl (am I doing this right)
-----

-----
Or they leak or they just don't release them at all. It's all down to the band in the end and i find it weird at all that if they go in with 15 why won't get just get 15 on the CD. Stadium Arcadium is one of the best examples of everything eventually getting released except for like 1 song on both the double album release and then a whole bunch of singles and b-sides later.
-----
Listen to Lost Dogs by Pearl Jam. Tons of great songs. Sometimes certain songs don't compliment the tone of an album
-----
Good catch
-----
Didn't he drown in his own vomit?
-----
I don't think anyone wants to drown in their own vomit from binge drinking because they miss their family and want to be with their daughter but hey maybe I'm in the wrong.
-----
If it's overdubbed heroin fueled tuning with JPJ randomly hitting piano keys, I have several spotify playlists to add it too

-----
Their bbc session is some of the best music I've heard
-----
BBC sessions was actually some of my favorites, maybe this new stuff will be a few little gems here and there too.
-----
BBC sessions' Since I've been Loving You was on repeat for a better part of a year in my CD player. I could air guitar the shit out of this track. 
-----
I was more thinking of Tupac when I made that comment. How many albums has that man dropped since he died?
-----
I also think Plant knows he can't do his own songs justice anymore. He didn't take particularly great care of his voice when he was younger, and now he's so old. It's hard to carry a tune as well as you once did with normal songs, but with Zeppelin songs it's pretty much impossible. Robert Plant wielded his voice like a weapon. It was an instrument all to itself. It would probably be painfully obvious how his voice isn't close to that anymore, and good on him for recognizing that and not trying to force it 
-----
There are still quite some examples of vocalists being able to sing in their later days, of course that number is very low compared to the ruined voices. Dio, Coverdale and Bruce Dickinson are some great examples of that. Yes their vocal range or power isn't/wasn't quite the same as in their prime but they're still able to pull off their own songs quite handily. Hansi Kursch and Jorn Lande are some who might be able to retain their prowess as well, although it's too early to judge since they're still only in their early 50s.
-----
Plant sang at higher pitch and snags had more vocal stress then Mick ever could hit. It takes a toll. Look what happened to Steve Perry of journey. Jagger is almost talking the songs and not singing. Its best for zepplin to stand down and retire gracefully like they have
-----
Mick Jagger has never not sounded like a donkey with a head cold being booted up the arse. It's not difficult to keep that up.
-----
I saw Plant at 2015 NOLA Jazz Fest. His band probably played 5+ Zep songs - and they were FANTASTIC. I remember looking down at my shoes in one part (Going to California which he improvised to Going to Louisiana ha), then closing my eyes... I was teleported back in time... that's how good he sounded.  While he may no longer be able to reach those soaring (piercing) highs anymore, he absolutely still has IT.

Nonetheless, I agree with others that he simply does not want to reunite Zep. Bad blood and all that ... plus, I think Plant prefers his solo routine now. 

Zep & Stones are among my favorite rock bands ... so this isn't about Mick or anything, just wanted to let you know Plant still crushes it!!!

His stage presence was MASSIVE - he said to the crowd that day, so cool & coy, as only a British rock legend could: "So I've been touring the states for about 50 years now... It's been a gas." 
-----
Just get the kid from Greta Van Fleet to do it then. 
-----
Paul Rodgers would like a word with you...
-----
Paul McCartney can still sing better than Jagger ever could on his best day in his prime.
-----
I don't think Plant was ever that good of a singer, I think Jimmy Page's production was responsible for making the early LZ albums sound good

Between Page being totally strung out on smack and Plant trying to sing songs that his range will not permit, some of those LZ live concert recordings are real trainwrecks
-----
Also have seen interviews where he says he just wants to focus in his new music, and do tours for that. 
-----
I saw him about 18 months ago - his voice was in good shape.  These are the Zep tunes he did:
Thank you 
How many more times
Going to California 
What is and should never be
Babe gonna leave you
Whole lotta love
Nobody's fault but mine

-----
Holy cow, I'm a huge zeppelin nerd and I've never heard of this. I looked it up, they even have the blues influenced guitar rifs and all. Sounds like it could be on Zepplin 1. 

The drum fills are decidedly not even close to John Bonham level though
-----
Listen to Black Smoke Rising.
-----
Safari Song sounds even more like a Zeppelin song. Pretty sure there's even a bit of the Black Dog solo in there as well.
-----
I think I'm inclined to agree with. 

the live version they played of Safari Song is one I wish was recorded. Shit's unbelievable. 
-----
>It's like they wrote a Zeppelin fanfic and this is the audiobook. 
>


That's the most amusing and apt description I have read yet! 


-----
I think you triple posted this.
-----
That's infuriating. The kid has every Plant-inflection down. They should just own it. 
-----
The singers mannerisms are straight from Plants playbook lol. 
-----
Nice! YYZ is probably not the easiest song to cover. 
-----
There was a local band where I went to college that was basically Green Day. When they actually covered Green Day, they sucked. Come to think of it, they pretty much sucked in general. : )
-----
Nothing says rock god like a hairless choir boy chest, lol
-----
Okay, Let me rephrase that. David Coverdale sounds like Robert Plant.
-----
Agreed.  Hopefully no one will do it this time.
-----
Such as now?
-----
They are worth catching live.
-----
They've talked about how each of them has an extremely different taste for music. They share an interest in blues and that is it.
-----
Highway Tune's main riff is very close to the verse riff of The Rover. That rhythm section also screams Jones and Bonham (busy bass lines and that loud snare).
-----
> From the inflections of his voice and the way the drums were recorded- everything was very deliberately made to sound like a zeppelin record.

That's a great point! There is so much more to "sounding like Zep" than simply playing zep-like notes and phrases in a zep-like arrangement with zep-like vocal melodies. The production decisions at every step definitely seem to be designed to make it mimic Zep. 
-----
to make money
-----
drums sound nothing like bonham, in tone or style. the drummer plays like every rock drummer in existence. the vocals are what sound identical to zep.
-----
they played in nashville recently.... small club...tickets sold out in no time and were getting resold for $200+
-----
Philly here as well. I'll join you.

-----
I just saw them in Lawrence last weekend. As soon as tickets go on sale, you need to buy them. It was totally worth it! If the venue had been better (floor was higher than stage), I would easily list it as the best show I've ever been to. Josh Kiszka sounds better live than on the albums, and actually showcased his range better while performing.
-----
Christ you're not kidding. Pulled em up on Spotify here at work and damn. That singer is a dead ringer for Plant. And they have tight instrumentation. I'm gonna have to grab a copy of their double ep on vinyl. 
-----
I thought that song was an LZ deep cut that had gained recent popularity until 5 minutes ago, when I opened this thread.
-----
Zoso does indeed. 


-----
I'd better go check them out so I can get this image of a Greta Van Susteren fronting a band out of my head.


-----
> In Your Face... not so much

Do You Like it is pretty much the only good song on there. 
-----
The Beatles
-----
The rolling stones.
-----
Oasis didn't really sound like the Beatles at all. The Beatles were much more sophisticated in their arrangements. Oasis were more anthemic. Slade would be a closer example. But it's a mix of a lot of things going on with Oasis. The first two albums, and B sides are amazing. Mixture of loud, in your face attitude. They sounded more like a mix of Slade, Sex Pistols, snatches of Smiths/U2, Beatles mixed with their with basic chord structures/melodies/drums. They get slagged a lot and adored in equal measure. Fact is, it is fucking hard to write an album of songs like 'Definitely Maybe' or 'Morning Glory'.  

At the time, it was everywhere and was great to be 15/16 when they were at their peak in Ireland/UK. 
-----
Yeah, but then your opinion doesn't matter.
-----
Two types of people in this world. There's people who like Led Zeppelin, and there's idiots. 
-----
Something is off with your comment. It seems to be wrong. 
-----
I wouldn't make the argument that Zeppelin perfected anything.

They ripped off a ton of people themselves and were douchebags about giving credit.

There's zero issue in a bunch of 20 year olds having their first recorded songs be Zeppelin-heavy music. If they release a full album of it then sure, your comments make sense.
-----
Hopefully because he has a whole lotta talent, man
-----
It would be a celebration day.
-----
Keith Moon heard Page's new band and said, "this will go over like a lead zeppelin" and so the name was born. 
-----
Absolutely not. Kashmir it's great, but there so many other better songs.
-----
N-n-n-never go to Texas anymore...
-----
Except made better, no problem with that
-----
Spoken like someone who doesn't understand the tradition of the blues in the slightest.
-----
depends who you ask. personally I prefer their albums that don't have covers
-----
I've learned that when a work unreleases a famous release that was previously an artist, there's a reason it was released.
-----
Difference being that Hendirx fucking tore it up live and was pretty much always "on." I might be in the minority here but Zeppelin was pretty hit or miss live. They weren't always so tight and Plant struggled bringing that studio Zep Polish to the stage. So pretty much anything Hendrix touched could be regurgitated to the masses from whatever source the estate finds and most of it sounds damn good while I believe much of the LZ stuff would need a lot more studio magic to make it acceptable for release.

Also, I really question the authenticity of some of the "outakes" released with their latest remaster series. Like, let's just kill the vocals on this track and call it an instrumental outtake or lets just switch the guitar track here and call it etc. 
-----
I was going to mention that one as an exception. but what I am most referring to are songs released after a band has broken up.  Pearl Jam is one of my favorites, but if 20 years from now (assuming they are no longer together) they announce they are releasing old unreleased material, I wouldn't hold my breath for anything great to come from it
-----
Hell yes

In the same vein, Soundgarden's 2014 Echo of Miles box set
-----
Yup and the dude drank so much, purportedly, because he missed being around his family. At least that's one thing I've heard about why he drank so much at the end.

Definitely not the way to go! 
-----
He drowned in vomit. They can't prove who's vomit it was. You can't really dust for vomit. 
-----
He drowned in his own vodka

Sounds like my ex wife

How can I find those? Was it released as a record?
-----
Wait until he releases his Voicemails album.
-----
I couldn't find my stupid password, and by the time I did I responded to the wrong comment, but:

Paul Rodgers would like a word with you...


-----
Jon Anderson of Yes comes to mind. 
-----
I second this
-----
There is only one god of thunder.
-----
Ain't no replacing Bonzo
-----
You only notice a drummer if he's doing something wrong - unless it's John Bonham. Dude could wail 
-----
That one sounds more like Heart
-----
Fuck I love that song! Listen to it a couple times a week. Just fucking crank it. GVF is awesome so far.
-----
They saved Highway Tune and Safari Song for the encore at the concert I saw. They're already pushing their biggest Zeppelin songs out of their main set. 

Drum solo to end it, which I thought was incredible, but I'm not that experienced to compare it to anything I've heard.
-----
Honestly after watching their first video they look and sound like a project put together by Berklee College of Music students (for anyone who doesn't know, it's like the rock 'n' roll music school) to mimic Zeppelin. Like someone hand picked them, rehearsed them on imitating Zep, and basically manufactured them to get famous. Which sucks because I can tell they're all talented, but it's so derivative as to be unlistenable without making the comparison, and of course they don't stand up to the original in any way. 
-----
As usual, JPJ gets no love. Those kids could sing and play like the rest of Zepp, but there's no chance that they have a multi-instrumentalist like Jones, because there really aren't more than a few like him in the world.
-----
I think you triple posted this
-----
Not for the drummer at least
-----
Neil Peart stands alone
-----
Sounds like they were, in fact, Green Day
-----
Green Day, like a lot of punk bands, is more about feel than talent. It's a hard things to emulate. Blink 182 and Nirvana are kinda the same. It's just really hard to cover bands whose music was never really about talent or technicality. 
-----
So.. Green Day?
-----
Green Day cover band confirmed.
-----
How do you fuck up a Green Day cover? Did the band only know two chords instead of three? 
-----
See now you could be talking about Zep or GVF. 
-----
I've been talking to you throughout this thread, but your post here makes me think the production was the advice of a studio head and might not've been GVF's desire. Based on the interviews I've seen and their live set lists, it seems possible.
-----
or maybe they enjoy doing it?
-----
I just looked at tix in Michigan next week... $298+ per ticket. I've never seen anything like that for a (as of yet) relatively unknown band. 
-----
they were at the Rock Allegiance tour as one of the openers, but I didnt care for the headlining bands. 

I checked their tour site, and they are basically doing festivals, and a few stops in Europe. 
-----
Philly here as well, I'll join you guys too but let me give this band a listen first. 
-----
[Please](https://i.giphy.com/media/BYhoMtJMQsYVy/giphy.webp)
-----
I saw them for free at the half shell at the oceanfront back home and it was legitimately a great show.
-----
It's hard to find a popular British rock act that weren't influenced by them in some way.
-----
Well they share the whole rough working class thing and the Stones are definitely an influence but being a different generation and one of the biggest bands of the decade I'll say Oasis took off and found their own identity. They are one of the main influences of actual brit rock bands (ie Catfish & The Bottlemen) so there must be something special about them.
-----
John Paul Jones was probably the best all around musician in that band and that is saying a lot.

Page live tended to be pretty sloppy.  All together though, my favorite band ever. 
-----
Sometimes the best things in life are sloppy. Blowjobs and chili dogs.
-----
His playstyle is kinda loose like that though. He has such amazing chops and technical ability, as well as song writing ability, that if he went on stage with literal spaghetti fingers he'd make it sound amazing. 
-----
Thanks Ian. 
-----
You know, I'm thinking of just going with "The Jeff Beck Experience" instead.
-----
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PROS7aKoZuY
-----
The guitar solo in this song is fucking solid.
-----
Spoken like someone who doesn't appreciate the genius of Page. That's ok. It's definitely not for everyone. Insane to think that Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, etc. didn't benefit from the British invasion. The explosion in popularity of those artists was initiated by it. They died relatively poor, but otherwise probably would have died broke.
-----
> Spoken like someone who doesn't understand the tradition of the blues in the slightest.

And also doesn't realize that the songs they took from others make up only a small fraction of their output.  Almost all of their best songs are original creations.
-----
How the west was won was the first Led Zeppelin album I ever bought so for some songs I prefer the live version over the studio versions. 
-----
Yeah, by the Physical Graffiti tour they were apparently pretty miss. There was a book I read that I can't remember the name of by a journalist who went on that tour with them and pretty much every show from their North American leg was disappointing. Page was pretty into heroin by that time too iirc. Guess their additudes and lifestyles got ahead of them.

Would still kill to go back in time and see them though. 
-----
LOVE that box set. Going to miss them immensely 
-----
Also he was a massive alcoholic
-----
Or maybe because he was an alcoholic
-----
I went to a foreigner and cheap trick concert and Jason Bonham (John Bomham's son) opened with a Zeppelin tribute band.  He gave a speech about his dad and then they rocked like hell. The singer sounded just like Robert Plant.
-----
I don't think people generally grasp how much he drank, either.  The day he died, he had 16 shots of vodka *for breakfast*, or around half a liter.
-----
Within about a year of each other. 
-----
Spotify has them
-----
Yeah, that's what I meant. His voice is nowhere near what it used to be before, but he can still perform live without sounding terrible.
-----
I sleep better at night knowing that he's watching over us.
-----
Take my upvote you speaker of truths
-----
Neil Peart 


-----
> You only notice a drummer if he's doing something wrong

This is absolutely 100% incorrect.
-----
Totally agree. Danny Carey is up there, too, in that sense. 
-----
I get a bit of a Rush feel from it. 
-----
Thank you. Of course I hear the Robert Plant similarities like everyone else but I was afraid I was going crazy and the only one hearing Ann Wilson in this kid's voice. 

That said those are two of my favorite rock vocalists anyway so I am definitely digging this band I just discovered this morning!
-----
Well, Heart has admitted to being heavily influenced by Zep. It all comes around.
-----
Considering their label is a division of Univeral records they probably were.
-----
I love Zeppelin. I am also completely unmusically gifted. But I think if I had that voice and could play like that I'd at least dabble in something similar because I think that's the only way I could enjoy the music any more than I already do.
-----
holy shit.  the only way id pay 300 for a show is if Bonzo came back from the dead and zep played a reunion show....and i get a free handski from mila kunis
-----
Relatively unknown yet everyone is talking about them?
-----
That's pretty shitty considering they're from Michigan.  I bet these kids were selling tickets to friends and family for $10 just a few years ago to come see them at St. Andrews.  
-----
The Stones were more influenced by guys like Chuck Berry than the Beatles I would say
-----
No he was just doped up.
-----
i see what you did there
-----
If anyone gives them a listen please tell me: what dyer maker them?
-----
He was definitely on heroin when he played it 
-----
Sounds awesome.
-----
Fucking incomprehensible amount of liquor!
-----
Thanks
-----
Neil has the precision but he doesn't have the rawness of bonham
-----
Right?! Like what a completely rubbish general statement. 
-----
Yeah, like, I'm into different "takes" on music, but this just isn't true. It could be said about most bassists or even rhythm guitar players, but not the drums.
-----
Who were both copying LZ for a few albums

-----
Fuck it why not both?
-----
I definitely get a Getty Lee vibe on that one 
-----
Totally worth it with the 'upgrade'
-----
I only mean to the mainstream audience. I can't name 5 people close to me that know of them, and I have a LOT of friends/family/acquaintances that are familiar with a lot of music.
-----
Rolling Stones were around so early that they weren't influenced by Beatles really that much.
-----
Not sure what to think yet, but I'll bet their time is gonna come
-----
I'll have you know that becoming an alcoholic is one of my life goals.
-----
Uh... what? Neil Peart demonstrates a level of mastery of drumming I've literally never heard before. Not just technical precision, but feel as well. If you like Bonham better, that's cool. They're both incredible drummers and have very different styles, and also two of my personal favorites. You don't even have to like Rush, but to call Neil Peart anything less than an astoundingly good drummer is both an insult to the instrument, and music itself
-----
Metronomes ain't got feel, that's why Bonham is the best. 
-----
Next you're going to tell me Mike Portnoy is pretty much the same level as Ringo right?
-----
In at least half of the most popular songs these days, the engineer is the only musician doing any work worth noticing.
-----
Not even bass players though really. Flea? John Entwistle? Dave Edwardson? Jack Bruce? Phil Lynott? Lemmy? All of those add an irreplaceable part to their music with their bass playing.
-----
I, for one, welcome the GFV revival.
-----
I mean, Jagger created his first garage band playing Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry and when the Rolling Stones first formed they were performing mainly Chicago Blues. Which were Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and stuff. I think it was super different than what the Beatles were doing. 
-----
this comment chain is the stairway to memedom
-----
 Trolls or idiot fanboys, ignore them. RUSH and Zeppelin are two of my favorite bands and if one can't compare and contrast even just two of some of the best rock and roll drummers in history and see the merits of both, then someone is high on crack.
-----
So true it hurts 
-----
Im going to crawl all over this thread
-----
Even a Black Dog can see these guys are Going To California once the Kashmir starts rolling in.
-----
I have three young kids and no cable. My kids are confused and annoyed by commercials. 
-----
Growing up in the 80's, I remember Saturday morning cartoons (back when they had cartoons) and all the commercials directed towards children.  I wanted so many toys just from the ads I saw.  I'm sure parents are happy that no ads are being shown to kids of today.  Save a little money not having to get the latest/greatest toy that just came out.

-----
I know the song from the Crossfire commercial will forever remain etched in my memory, but I've always wondered what my kids are "missing out" on by not being bombarded with cereal and toy commercials. However, I quickly deemed it not much and dismissed the thought. Stunning to have a numerical value assigned to it, though.
-----
I get local channels over antenna and I recently turned it to Qubo for my toddler and HOLY BALLS, the adverts on that channel are egregious. Infomercials for crappy toys with ridiculous shipping & handling / processing fees.

Oh well, back to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and PBS Kids streaming.

-----
Also with Netflix they won't stumble on Elsa eating Spiderman's poop
-----
When we visit friends who have the Disney channel, my kids watch the commericals and turn into "i want" machines.  It's pretty stark.  I love watching the cartoons of my youth without the commericals. 

We watch youtube and for  some reason we only see anti tobacco dip commercials and it's been that way for like 8 months. 
-----
No doubt.  We only have DVDs and Prime, and my kids are always astounded when they see "real" TV.

They had to watch some football during Thanksgiving, and that Apple commercial where people dance in the streets together came on, and my 12-year-old son looked at me and said, "what does people dancing in the street have to do with computers??"
-----
No commercials is great. Kids still get 'commercials' from friends, YouTube sponsor plugs, etc.. 

As for me, it's a blessing and a curse. I miss out on some great shows (not advertised) but I also don't have to listen to extremely repetitive commercials. I got Sling for the holidays. I REALLY don't miss commercials. At all. I forgot how bad they were. Not just a few in a row, but more often cutting into the show itself. 

Now that my kids are older, though, their desires are a bit more expensive. They want a better gaming computer (my son bought his own parts and built his own, but I'm getting him accessories for Christmas!). Commercials didn't really have a lot to do with it. Just friends and a desire to want the best stuff. 

Now - don't get me started on magazines. I'll read a home theater magazine and really want to spend $10K on some new equipment. That stuff really pulls you in!  
-----
Damn kids with their ad free services and ad blockers. Back in my day you memorized the commercial jingles! 
-----
This has made Christmas so much easier for me and my 4 yr old.
He's not asking for a bunch of garbage he's seen advertised on TV for christmas.
Only legos.  Tons and tons of legos.  
-----
We have three kids (none of them very young anymore), and they hate ads now.  They will put up with them if there is something they want to watch live (usually with my wife who likes to watch ads!), but they would rather avoid them if possible.  
-----
My boyfriend and I only watch Netflix and downloads, so whenever I go over to my parent's house and watch TV with commercials, it seems really bizzare. You kind of forget how weird commercials are.
-----
Is this rendering these kids entirely unprepared for the barrage of advertising they'll be faced with later on? Will they naively think ads are truthful? 
-----
But what about gems like...

CROSSFIRE!!!

You'll get caught up in the...CROSSFIRE!

CROSSFIRE! CROSSFIRE! CROSSFIRE! 
-----
Bullshit. They watch YouTube channels dedicated to playing with new toys. Instead if a 30 second commercial of a product, now sits 10 minutes. 
-----
How much time was saved with the option to skip intros now
-----
It's funny when you indoctrinate people. I setup my wife's laptop for her any time she gets a new one: adblock,uBlock Origin etc (whatever is the going thing at the time).

She started a new job and occasionally reads the news sites on her lunch break. She came home like "I think there's a virus on the work system, all the sites are horrible".
-----
Ever since the invention of Tivo and DVR's I've dedicated my life to never watching another commercial ever again
-----
This is why I also pay for youtube red.
-----
My two year old always yells, "No thank you!", whenever a commercial comes on at her Grandparents house.
-----
This post is ruining some advertiser's day
-----
thats really cool, maybe this will help to stop raising more robot consumers. stay woke
-----
Cable used to be devoid of commericals.
-----
TIL this Subreddit exists. Instant sub. 
-----
I have a 21yr old daughter and my youngest is 10. I have seen a huge difference in what and how they become interested in certain things as kids over the years. I can remember my oldest being bombarded with the same commercials for the same stupid toy over and over. Basically being brainwashed while watching disney or nickelodeon. What did she ask for when her birthday or christmas rolled around? Yep, you guessed it that stupid junk piece of plastic I just knew she would lose interest in quickly. Now that we no longer have cable and my youngest probably hasn't seen a real toy commercial in years. I noticed she asks for things she sees her friends playing with or something she actually has interest in and not just blindly repeating what a commercial has brainwashed into her head like my oldest did back in the day. 
-----
The youtube toy channels like evantube and hobbykids are just 10-30 minute long toy commercials though. So it's kind of a wash for a lot of kids. 
-----
A few times a year, we stay at a hotel and the kids get a taste of real tv. The older kids are super annoyed by the ads while the young ones are blown away by them. We all just wanna skip em and binge.
-----
Ad blocker makes YouTube 300% better.
-----
We have to keep going.

We cant go back to commercial hell. 
-----
Didn't they recently do a study that showed kids that watched less commercials generally weighed less too? Meaning, they weren't inundated with commercials for food products so they were less inclined to eat junk food.
-----
I noticed that my kid never had any idea what to ask for around Christmas and birthday.  (Minus obvious cell phone but after she got it, she ran out of ideas again.)  Only see commercials on YouTube.  
-----
My youngest watches Netflix exclusively by and large and the only gift he specifically asked for this year was Ark Survival for the PS4, and that was solely down to some YouTuber playing it. 


-----
Yup.  We cut the cable about the time my first was born.

It is astonishingly amazing how different their lives are from when I was a kid.  When I was a kid, I had *lists* of gifts I wanted at birthday and Christmas time - all from what I had seen on TV.

Now when holidays come around, my kids have absolutely zero idea what the want.  In fact (and sadly), the don't really play with toys at all.  Everything is digital for them.  They are either on their ipads or on the computer.  They are now starting to ask for video games, as they see "playthroughs" on YouTube.

YouTube is their main source of video entertainment.  If you could call it that.  Basically it's people who talk non-stop.  
-----
My parents cut the cord when I was about 14 (I'm 20 now). As a result, I often don't know what movies are playing, what hot new thing taco bell is selling, what new pharmaceuticals are on the market or the newest smartphones are being sold.

It's also given me the proactivity of installing adblockers, and has shown me what a waste of money cable is.
-----
My house went all streaming 2 years ago and I actually find myself buying less crap. 
-----
But who will think of the poor advertising companies?!
-----
We get OTA signals that we rarely use but we decided to "tune in" to a Christmas thing on broadcast TV and my child was pissed off and started screaming at the TV all of sudden and I couldn't figure out why she was so upset and throwing a temper tantrum.  Then it occurred to me that she did not know what a commercial was.  She thought it got switched to something else entirely.   Either that or she genuinely hates it when daddy buys mommy a new Lexus on TV.  
-----
Be nice if they would warn you about *what* makes something TV MA...kissing? Compound Fracture? Crossdressing penetration?
-----
Ads are so weird to me now. They seem so fake and gross.
-----
My inlaws record shows on their DVR for their grandkids to watch when they're over. They get so confused when a commercial interrupts their show.

My wife has some old VHS tapes from her childhood (Cinderella, Beauth and the Beast, etc.). We were babysitting our niece one time and popped a VHS into the VCR and hit play... she absolutely could not understand why we couldn't just "skip" the previews.

Also, the idea of the credits running *before* the movie almost had her in tears because she thought the movie was already over before it had even begun.
-----
Kids in homes with no TV at all are being saved from a lot more. 
-----
Now, if i could just stop the grandparents from giving my son the god damned tablet so he stops looking at youtube he'd be commercial free. I love my folks but they're the enemy when it comes to my son.... and "NO MORE CHICKEN NUGGETS!"
-----
i don't have a problem with real tv channels as long as it's the re run channels like me tv,this tv,cozi tv,antenna tv,retro tv,grit,laugh,and pluto. that's all i tend to watch .... along with whatever streaming app i might be signed up for. 
-----
Lucky bastards. 
-----
Do it for the children
-----
I loved commercials as a kid. 
-----
Install pi-hole on your network. Adblocking for every device.
-----
To be replaced by 260 more hours of Netflix 
-----
Allowing them to watch and rewatch bee movie uninterrupted
-----
That's a lot of TV viewing. Commercials or not we have to get our youth out from in front of a screen constantly.
-----
I haven't had cable in 4 years, I absolutely hate watching football online bc of the ads
-----
I like commercials 
-----
Hulu kids and amazon prime does not have commercials either.
-----
It's amazing how this lack of advertising affects our kids. They never ask for stuff like my sister's and I did as kids. When asked what they want for Christmas they have a hard time coming up with more than one item that they want. 
-----
Parents are saved from the commercials too!
-----
we have no tv service in our house.
-----
Invaluable. 
-----
I was in a target yesterday and a child was screaming for her parent to purchase some item that she saw on a commercial. Brilliant parenting by netflix only homes.
-----
BBC did it first
-----
We use netflix a lot, but one thing I really appreciate about the disney channel and nick jr are that they play their shows (at least cartoons) commercial free then have ~6minutes of commercials before the next one begins. 

With a toddler, we can let him watch a show, but when it's over, we go do something else and he doesn't have to sit through commercials to get through a single show. 
-----
Well they're not being saved from lootboxes.
-----
And then there's /r/elsagate
-----
REPORT: Netflix has no commercials. 
-----
Mine found the DUMB youtube channels "advertising" toys as they open them..... Worse than 260 hours of commercials a year. Stupid blind bags.
-----
Instead, that 260 hour goes to searching Netflix for something to actually watch.
-----
Dilly dilly!
-----
Oddly enough, does anyone else feel like something is missing when binge watching? It doesn't happen often but at 30 years old, I think I'm so conditioned with commercials that at times I just put on the local channels I receive for free to just have that background npise. Almost like the commercials do give me time to decompress. It sounds crazy and I do hate commercials, but sometimes it just doesn't feel like tv haha
-----
Well, except YouTube. 
-----
This is why they pushed so hard for the NN repeal. The real money is by selling ad space injected into video streams.
-----
My kids hate this when we go on vacation. "Why is the show stopping all the time?" "Why can't we pause it?"

I rarely have the feeling or want to buy things, but I get them when I start browsing specific areas of Reddit/forums. Sports? Oh man maybe we should get tickets to the game. Video games? That switch came out and now I'm playing PUBG. But other than that, we're a very limited commercial household and it's wonderful.
-----
My kids are going to so confused when they go to a friends house, use their computer and their parents don't use an Ad Blocker.
-----
Ironically, this post is an ad.
-----
Everyone forgets about product placement.
-----
For as little as $8 a month you can save a ~~neglected~~ lovingly raised child from hundreds of hours of ads. Please pick up your child today and *interact* with them.
-----
But what about the fact that kids are learning they don't have to wait to see what happens next. I'm not just talking about binging here but even a few minutes during that pause of suspense makes a difference. 
-----
If you are 30+ this means if you had netflix you'd have almost an entire extra year to live.
-----
Serious question: Is there anyway to assess the cost-benefit of bingewatching over an absence of commercials?
-----
also adblock for youtube...
-----
What's really funny to me is the only way they would see commercials is through YouTube. Yet the advertising companies don't wish to be associated with the content coming out on that platform. They are missing a chuck of the market due to their own stubbornness to look forward.
-----
Spending that extra 260 hours binge watching shows. 
-----
Yet are exposed to programming that ruins their minds.

It's okay, their parents are gonna have to live with it.
-----
And it makes Christmas time so much easier as well - They are not inundated with shitty toys and really end up getting what they want rather than just well timed commercials during the Holidays.
-----
I remember in the early 2000s my cousin was a toddler and my aunt would gladly accept any and all VHS/DvDs she could find.

He'd endlessly demand things he saw on commericals. So she ended up having to use vhs/dvds in order to watch anything without the constant annoyance of commericals and begging.
-----
No joke, when I watch TV these days I imagine it feels close to Roman days walking down a street of vendors. "Buy This!!"  "Miracle cure!!"  "Insert own sleazy quote!"
-----
Good. I hate ads, I wouldn't wish them on any children.

I refuse to support ads in any way. If I can block them, I will.
-----
Thats 1.5 months of fultime work...
-----
My kid gets all the advertising she needs from Youtubers with toy sponsorships. CookieSwirlC anyone?
-----
For now.
-----
Why I was just speaking of that
-----
Hey, adults too. Won't someone think of the adults??!
-----
Now it's replaced with 260 hours of " what do I want watch?"
-----
Real firstworldproblems
-----
Anytime I'm out in public these days at a bar or something where there's commercials on the tvs, I'm awestruck by the amount of effort that goes into these things. There was some commercial for a samsung phone of some sort, and it had a ton of vivid colors, and synchronized dancing. It looked like a Wes Anderson movie clip on acid.

I'd never buy the product, but it was hypnotizing.
-----
Yep, been a cordcutter since before my daughter was born (coming on 8 years now).  She is practically offended by commercials.

I will say this, I am a little sad that in her on-demand world she will never know the feeling of Saturday Morning Cartoons.
-----
Any issues with instant gratification?
-----
Not just kids...
-----
aaaaaaaaaaaaaand is down
reddit hug of love
-----
We spent Thanksgiving in a hotel with cable. My 5-year old daughter turned into a little maniac watching commercials in kid's TV. Glad is was only those three days ...
-----
I don't have Netflix, I have just satellite tv with a recorder thing in it. I haven't watched an ad in a long time.
-----
Further cementing Disney's monopoly and reducing employment opportunities by hundreds of thousands of jobs.  
-----
If they ever go to the movie theatre, that number goes up
-----
other report: kids in Netflix only homes watch boatloads more TV.
-----
However, it's my understanding Netflix does product placement. (The whole Playstation scene in House of Cards for example)

So it's not totally commercial free.
-----
I actually enjoy commercials.  But I like sports and enjoyed the Entertainment Weekly era that included Must See TV amd all that went eith it.  Ratings wars, block scheduling, all that.  I stream or on demand everything these days but I also enjoy flipping channels aimlessly.  I am def in the minority on this sub tho
-----
When we go to my parents house and a commercial for toys comes on my kid is immediately in zombie "i want that" mode.  He's 5, but it's still creepy how fast that shit works.
-----
I feel this will bring rise to more product placement
-----
My older two grew up with commercials, but my younger two (large gap between the two groups) were born into a cord-cutter house and are 7 now. The difference is rather stark, and not just on Sundays when we watch football OTA and they are baffled by the commercials. 

The younger kids have zero concept of brands, which makes _everything_ easier; clothes, shoes, food, toys. Seriously, just everything. The few toys they ask for revolve around TV shows they watch on Netflix, but since "current" isn't a concept anymore, they like some really old stuff which leads to cheap buys or hand-me-down toys from their much older brother (his crap's still in my basement...). Even then, some of those TV inspired "toys" aren't toys. They watch a few cartoons with a super brainy scientist character, so "a science lab" is a big request. As a parent, how do you complain about that? Their current "best toy ever" is a rock tumbler. 

Gift buying for them is legitimately difficult. At Christmas and birthdays when family members want ideas, my wife and I have to sit down and work out what we can tell people to get them. As a result, a majority of their toys are educational  (snap-circuits, various construction toys, learning video games, science kits of various types, and tons of books), and they are ecstatic to receive them.

A few times I've wondered if this is really a case of not being bombarded with commercials, or just who they are. One week at their grandparents in the summer watching cable, however, quickly erases any doubts. The amount of crap that they "NEED" after spending time in a house with cable TV is insane. 
-----
They have no idea what we have saved them from
-----
Tomorrow on Fox: Millenials are ruining television!
-----
REPORT: Product placement on the rise.
-----
I feel like watching all those commercials when I was a kid really screwed with my perception of things. The ads on the cartoon stations I watched as a kid are wildly different than stations for adults. It's downright predatory. Now I can't watch any TV, or movies at all. I'm disgusted by the gentrification of it. It's all just a big ad for something. So whitewashed and perfect. 
-----
All the time, "Dad, how do I skip this?"
-----
D'oh, why do I have to have three kids and no cable instead of three cable and no kids?!
-----
Yeah, my 3YO is like that.  I'll put a show on Netflix or a DVD and they watch it start to finish.  If I put a show on YouTube (they have the old-school Frosty the Snowman and Rudolph the Red-Noses Reindeer from when I was a kid) they'll be watching the show while I cook dinner, and suddenly I'll hear "Daddy!  I don't want to watch this, I want Frosty!"  Yup...gotta teach them how to skip commercials next.
-----
Good kids. Make your parents proud.
-----
Uh oh. I'm taking the kids to their grandparents' for the weekend. This... may not go well.
-----
strangely, mine is captivated by commercials. if i'm watching sports and he's playing with toys in the room, he will stop and watch the commercials before resuming his playing when the game is back.
-----
When my daughter was about 2 she would have a melt down when she would watch tv at my parents' place and commercials came on. She can tolerate any amount of buffering like it's nothing but one commercial and she was ready for war. 
-----
Raising them correctly.
-----
My kids think tv at grandma's is so weird
-----
Same here, my daughter thinks TV with commercials is unwatchable (just like her dad!).
-----
But can they recognize the product placements within the programs themselves as advertisements?

Having distinct barriers between entertainment and advertisements was a feature to help consumers understand when they are being advertised to.
-----
My daughter is 6 and we have never had cable. Whenever she was in a position to witness cable commercials she got incredibly angry and started yelling at the TV. 
-----
Why can't I have no kids and three cable
-----
Same with mine. The YouTube ads that's come on make my kid super annoyed. They also make me super annoyed too. 
-----
play everything at 1.25x speed
-----
My niece is 2 and has already learnt how to skip them on her ma's smartphone.
-----
I admire that. After 10 years of Netflix I can't even watch a half-hour show on commercial TV anymore. It's hard to believe I put up with all the garbage for so many years. 
-----
as it should be. 
-----
I was a piece of shit when I was a kid every time we went to the store because I begged for things and products constantly. I grew up watching a lot of TV and probably saw a ton of commercials.

Does the lack of commercials change this behavior in kids? All I know is that I'm not letting my kids watch anything at all with commercials in it.
-----
I don't think the kids are being "saved" from anything. My kids don't see any traditional commercials because we have netflix and I block the youtube ones.

As it turns out, much of the kids content on youtube is just one giant advertisement. Every youtube star has their own line of junk. Guess what 50% of their christmas lists are made up of?
-----
None for us.  We have YT Red family plan.  I created an Gmail for my toddler and added it to the family plan, then use that to login on her devices--old unused Droid Razr M's--if there is a YT Red account on the phone, YT Kids gains offline videos and no commercials automatically.

People sleep on Red, but between no commercials for my YT watching, Google Music (replacing Spotify) and both no commercials for YT Kids *and* offline videos, it's really great.
-----
Run a Pihole and also see 0 ads! [/r/Pihole](www.reddit.com/r/pihole) !!
-----
My question is what kind of trauma does someone have to endure in order to end up as an adult that videotapes himself or herself playing with childrens toys
-----
ublock gets rid of YouTube ads. It's heavenly. 
-----
Adblock means only the uninformed still see youtube ads.
-----
Man I got YouTube red (through Google music premium) and Netflix. I never deal with ads. It is amazing. Totally worth the 20 bucks a month 
-----
What ads? No child of mine would use a computer without an ad blocker of some kind.
-----
I notice that my 5 and 3 year old definitely lack any brand recognition at grocery stores likely from little to no commercials, but they still find everything else to ask for.  No brain washing about Lucky Charms, Sunny D, or any other garbage.
-----
>  I wanted so many toys just from the ads I saw.

Yup.  My brothers and I would constantly say "I want that" to just about every commercial.  And then a commercial for some Strawberry Shortcake doll would come on and we'd torment each other by saying "*YOU* want that!"
-----
Eh, parents still have to buy the same amount of crap for kids today.  They just find out about it in different ways.
-----
Ads were so good during the 70s and 80s though, much more entertaining than current ads.
-----
I had no idea what Disneyland was growing up, but I knew I wanted to go there based on the commercials. 
-----
You'll get caught up in the...CROSSFIAAAYAAAA!
-----
My whole childhood I thought it was "You'll get caught in love... CROSSFIRE" 

>  I know the song from the Crossfire commercial will forever remain etched in my memory

I can rattle off like 8 mattress brands because of the Sit N Sleep radio commercials Ive been hearing for 30 years
-----
i feel like that same crossfire commercial played during every single commercial break for my entire childhood.
-----
I wanted one of those so bad as a kid but never got one.  

The fact I'm 34 and remember how badly I wanted that damn game speaks volumes for the effectiveness of their marketing campaign. 

I still remember thinking how bad ass those kids in the commercial looked. 
-----
random thought here -- but the commercial that sold me a toy was the commercial for the Ricochet RC car.

What's odd is that the product turned out to be just as awesome as the ad acted like it was -- you just had to have the right terrain/area to drive it around in. I loved that goddamn RC car.
-----
Fads somehow still manage to find them. I didn't see any commercials for fidget spinners when they initially exploded in popularity.
-----
Or Creepy Crawlers.
-----
I had that game just because of the song and how rad the older kids looked playing it.  It collected dust because it sucked.  

-----
wait is that song "Crossfire" by Stevie Ray Vaughan?
-----
That's what we use too.   Roku is nice. 
-----
What in the living hell is that all about?! My kids found that on the YouTube Kids app, of all things.

I spent a significant amount of time on YouTube Kids after that incident, and found that it is much worse that regular YT. Nearly every approved video was either some kid slightly older that was "cool" and peddling some toy for 20 mins, or these "on the fringe" weird-ass videos with super heros and Disney characters doing questionable stuff.

We finally removed the kids app and started putting a big emphasis on teaching them what was appropriate and not. We created their own Google accounts, and I consistently monitor their viewing history. When something comes up that is questionable, we have a "you are not in trouble" discussion about what makes it appropriate or not appropriate.

Its fucking scary out there. I can't believe the parents of young kids that just hand them a tablet and forget about it. The shit your kid could be watching is frightening. 

EDIT: We also have approved channels they are allowed to watch. They don't get to just start selecting the Recommended Videos that pop up. They have to stay in their lanes, and they can ask about certain publishers for us to review.

> I love watching the cartoons of my youth without the commericals.

If you grew up in the 80s, the cartoons WERE the commercials.
-----
> We watch youtube and for some reason we only see anti tobacco dip commercials and it's been that way for like 8 months.

Could be worse.  We were watching kids videos on YouTube once and the commercial that kept coming up was some sort of pro-gun "the apocalypse is coming so buy guns and teach your kids to shoot" crap.  Nothing like going from "The Wheels on the Bus" to apocalyptic imagery to ruin your kid's day.
-----
Almost two years ago, we stayed at a hotel for a few days because our power was out. Our boys saw one ad for something called "booger balls." They *still* talk about booger balls to this day.
-----
> I love watching the cartoons of my youth without the commercials. 

I'll be honest: Occasionally I like watching cartoons of my youth *with* the commercials. Mostly via elusive VHS recordings.
-----
Did you explain what an advertisement is?
-----
Wait for them to see a perfume ad. 
-----
The thing is that gaming computers are a hobby. Not that much different from kids that want to buy the latest 400 dollar paintball gun, or maybe the kid that wants to spend 1000 dollars on the sexy new compound bow. (I used to be like this). Much better than wanting the limited time offer for some burger place or some detergent and ABCmouse subscriptions.
-----
>Kids still get 'commercials' from friends, YouTube sponsor plugs, etc..

>Not just a few in a row, but more often cutting into the show itself.

My favourite is that now they are pushing banner ads directly into TV programming [like](https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/m-panasonictvad.jpg) [this](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5048e660e4b0bd178ab35a57/t/56374f5ce4b0f705d4f2f50a/1446465374286/). I've also seen [claims](https://lifehacker.com/network-television-stations-speed-up-tv-shows-to-fit-in-1797131517) that networks are speeding up broadcasts up to 10% just to be able to play more ads in a 30 minute timeslow.

What barrage of ads later on? Kids watching Netflix will grow up into adults watching Netflix (or whatever the equivalent will be in the future). By then we'll be wearing billboard blocking VR goggles anyway, so advertising will be a thing of the past.

Now I need to start producing in-goggle VR ads....

Maybe they were just watching less TV in general, thus less commercials.
-----
I know that is true for me!
-----
>All the time, "Dad, how do I skip this?"

That's hilarious. Time is going by so fast. I wonder what other common-place things will be strange annoyances to future generations. 
-----
Same thing when they hear a radio station. 
-----
Yep, even when we had cable, we had a ReplayTV DVR that had automatic commercial skip.  When the kids were younger and watching TV at the grandparent's house, they would yell out "Skip."  To which grandma had to break the news to them every time "My TV doesn't do that."


-----
Do your kids not want the products pushed by youtube personalities or the merchandises of the shows themselves?
-----
I explained the Tickle-Me-Elmo clusterfuck to a younger cousin and he thought I was fucking with him.
-----
We were at the grandparent's when a toy commercial came on. I don't think she saw one before. Her eyes became as big as saucers and immediately after says, "Dad, I want one." 

I hate commercials. I hate advertising. I fucking detest marketing towards children. Incidentally I'm in the middle of watching Fed Up and the marketing towards kids is insane. 
-----
No cable, no kids, no worries mo monies.
-----
I'd hate to have three cable.  Cable is terrible.  TV in general is terrible.  
-----
My 3yo niece goes down the YT rabbit hole. We have to watch her like a hawk. She gets into all these Play-Doh / Trolls / LOL Suprise Doll mashup videos and ends up wanting everything.

"daddy, grandma's TV is broken. It doesn't have YouTube or a [microphone] search thing" - my daughter.

Careful.  If you don't nip it in the bud he might go into Sales..
-----
Fun fact: Children's fascination with commercials is why Sesame Street had those "this episode is brought to you by the letter Y" scenes and the format of the show in general.
-----
My kids too. We only have Netflix & Amazon at home but when we stayed at a hotel recently we let them watch some kids channel. They were *enthralled* by the commercials and begged for every toy they saw advertised, even the toys they were too old for. My husband was also very amused when they dragged me over to the TV to show me a commercial for a weight loss product!
-----
THANK YOU! My kid does exactly the same thing! She actually likes commercials, which she strangely calls "previews" no matter how many times I correct her.
-----
Does Sling have commercials??
-----
Saved might not be the best word. But I'm certainly not going to complain about them seeing fewer hours of commercials.
-----
It's not just children as companies are figuring out youtube advertising is far cheaper than traditional broadcast media.
tune into any men's fashion channel and you'll find relentless plugging for: watches, belts, underwear, custom suits/shirts, hair styling products and subscription models for virtually anything you can think of.
-----
There's got to be about a billion different Paw Patrol toys... a billion
-----
In case you aren't already, I would be careful with this, too. I've heard horror stories of children whose parents blocked youtube ads. When actual popups started surfacing, sometimes those children, as they became adults, would fall for the ad because they didn't recognize it was only a malicious ad.

Not trying to step in and do your parenting! Just trying to prevent a little headache along the way from Internet illiteracy and foreign prince money scams :P
-----
>Every youtube star has their own line of junk. Guess what 50% of their christmas lists are made up of?

I haven't experienced that, but my 9 year old daughter definitely has picked up some gift ideas from YT (we're also a no-cable tv house, so she doesn't see ads and I use adblock for YT).

Know what she asked me for an xmas gift? Fucking gummies. Those gummy candies shaped like food, like hamburgers and hotdogs and pizza and stuff. She really wanted those.

I'll take that trade LOL. I'm getting her a couple video games anyways just to be nice, but seriously the only thing she got in her head for xmas this year was gummies, because she saw some girl on YT playing with them and eating them and microwaving them and stuff.
-----
We're just going back to the days where shows are sponsored by x and the commercial will be right in the middle of the show. Fun fact: soap operas are called such because they were first sponsored by soap companies marketing to housewives.
-----
> Guess what 50% of their christmas lists are made up of?

LOL Surprise Dolls? Fucking $10 each.
-----
Blind box toys and slime kits?

I'm glad they aren't getting the full on commercial - but they are getting advertised to - they are also living in an ondemand, no patience world as well.

Can't wait to see how that goes in 20 years.
-----
Hehe, kids in the 80s got to watch commercials that broke up excellent shows like Transformers, Ninja Turtles, and a bunch of other stuff that were basically designed to sell toys. Sounds like not much has changed. Thanks, early 80s deregulation!
-----
My niece always begs her parents for some streamer game of the week, always some shitty game that she gets bored of after a few days.  The latest example is that Getting Over It game.
-----
At least then the money is going to the content makers. 
-----
Can confirm.... STUPID blind bags....The entire youtube channels are simply opening toys each episode....
-----
Yup. Both of my kids asked for a YouTubers shirt. 
-----
I do this too.

But I simply don't know how to block ads on the YouTube app for phones and the TV! 

My pc on the other hand is fine
-----
Except that the kids videos are largely just paid ads. 
-----
YouTube's problem is they push their original content as the selling point. No commercials, offline downloads, and listening to videos in the background on mobile should be what they push.
-----
The videos themselves are just cleverly disguised ads, though.
-----
Keep in mind most kids are either using a tablet or TV to watch YouTube, which is where YouTube Red comes in handy.
-----
Right, I forget youtube has ads sometimes.
-----
I just went ahead and got YouTube Red. Ad free on all devices as long as I sign in. Plus I get a Google Music subscription for free on the side :D
-----
If you have a google music subscription, youtube red is free.
-----
That... is fucking awesome.

Seriously I hadn't thought about the ramifications of not having constant ads attacking your child's mind 24/7

edit: this reminds me of some kind of "unplugging" from society -- only you're not -- you are just cutting out the garbage part of it, the commercials. You still get to have socially adjusted kids that know all the latest shows just without the constant attack of ads. 

which *do* feel like an attack, if you go without ads for a long time then are introduced to them. it feels like you are being yelled at like a fucking moron, like that awesome south park commercial 
-----
This is the biggest thing I noticed. I remember complaining about the cereal mom bought with I was a kid. The stuff I wanted was the most unhealthy, mass produced crap. My kids now just want what they think tastes best which happens to be granola, bran flakes, etc. They like the nuts and fruit and other things. They hate rice crispies, think the marshmallows in cereal are too sweet/make them feel sick. It's pretty fascinating really.

Same for drinks. They don't really like koolaid and would prefer water or regular juice.

Kids today want the same things I want. Minecraft youtuber parafanilia

DUDE! We got a Toys R Us (I think) catalog in the mail and I about lost my mind when I saw Crossfire in it! Pretty sure the catalog indicated it's exclusive to them, though.

Edit: Yep, there it is: https://www.toysrus.com/product?productId=119030186
-----
Random question.  Do you remember what comes after...

"IIIII plaaaaaaaay right field, its important you know" 
-----
I think we all did, and some of us still do.

Off topic, but I will say the nice thing about being a young adult with a career and disposable income is we can buy all the dumb stuff we couldn't as kids. The legacy line of Power Ranger toys is my weakness...


-----
As someone who successfully convinced his dad to get one for him in the 90s, watching the commercial is more fun that playing the game
-----
I played at a friends house.

It sucked.

One of the beads ricochet'd off the spinner thingy and hit me in the eye. Thankfully it only hit the upper part of my eye, and not the eye itself.
-----
I 'member those commercials. Damn, my kids really aren't missing much if I can say I remember toy commercials more fondly/vividly than memories with my family
-----
Yeah, I blame that on my kids (all three are five and under) watching a lot of YouTube videos. The commercials haven't died, they've just changed form.
-----
I hear they're spooky, goopy, purple, and green. The grossest little creatures that you've ever seen!
-----

-----
H3H3 had some great videos about this in January but they still exist. Idk but I no longer let my kid YouTube and only have Netflix if he wants to watch stuff. 
-----
[I learned about this shit from r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7d5in3/a_group_of_perverts_are_targeting_kids_on_youtube/)
-----
Yeah but action figures are cool.
-----
No doubt!  Gummibears, pacman, qbert were among my early favorites.
-----
Not much has changed today. Merchandising of TV shows is still prevalent in toy aisles. There's now merch for YouTube personalities that are popular among kids, as well.
-----
Good old Regan.
-----
wow....I think their metrics are off.  My kids just want to watch the Ghostbusters and Harry Potter theme songs again, not see what a dude with jaw cancer looks like. 
-----
Holy shit. I never even thought about it before but I've never seen anything gun related in an ad (don't live in USA). Do you guys get actual gun commercials as well?
-----
I tried, but it was hard to explain how dancing in the streets equalled Apple products.  He was equally confused by the dillydilly commercials.
-----
Is it confusing and surreal?  Is it shot totally in B&W?  Then it's a perfume ad.
-----
True. But, when I was young the commercials (and cartoons, which my dad accurately called 30 minute long commercials) were an incentive to invest in the collectible robotic figurines (Transformers) or the highly collectible and long term investment of McDonalds unopened figurine. :) Tried to put that spin on it. Didn't work. 
-----
>The thing is that gaming computers are a hobby.

Be kind, rewind.

Guess-I-forgot-to put the-foglights-in.
-----
Yea I hope not too, I haven't had cable since 2011 but I think commercials are exactly the same as before, just boring as hell..
-----
Some obvious ones:

Locking/unlocking doors, manual driving, not having a bidet, grocery stores.
-----
Manually jerking off
-----
having jobs
-----
Using channel 3 to play video games!! 
-----
Getting lost, kids never have to deal with that anymore. Such a weird thing to think about.
-----
A couple years ago my 3 year old tried to "zoom in" on our tv by touching the tv with a "reverse pinch" gesture.
-----
"Dad, Why come Elon and Jeff get to decide my fate?"

"Because their better than us, darling. It's human nature."
-----
No commercials, on demand watching. So radically different than when I was a kid.
-----
Shit i remember when we didnt even have a remote. We would rock, paper, scissors to see who would change the channel.
-----
I think unskippable ads will come at some point in streaming 
-----
When I was your age, if we wanted to change the channel, we had to walk across the room and push a button on the TV.
-----
Sometimes I miss commercial breaks. I know I can just pause stuff, but it feels different. Also, if you're watching with others, pausing too much would be rude, but commercials are unavoidable!
-----
"And that's the way it was and we LIKED IT!"
-----
Back in my day I had a VCR and had it all programmed to auto start recording at certain times. I guess that would be called AVR? 
-----
Or swap the channel and watch to shows in a sloppy way in order to avoid breaks.
-----
Was going to say, just because kids aren't watching TV ads anymore let's not at all act like the marketing industry hasn't caught up. Google is one of the largest companies in the world and they are literally an advertising company. If you think you're being sly and never seeing ads you're probably very wrong and just don't notice the ones subtle enough not to solicit an annoyed response from you. 
-----
My daughter mostly watches YouTube. She asks for slime supplies, nail art kits, and drawing stuff. She likes the tutorial channels the most. She also started teaching herself Japanese through Duolingo and asked for a calligraphy set so she can learn Kanji. I don't mind that kind of product marketing. 
-----
Incidentally, the Tickle Me Elmo craze was driven by product placement on [Rosie O'Donnell's show](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-12-22/business/9612191493_1_elmo-tickle-rosie), rather than typical commercials. Then came the scarcity because Tyco couldn't keep up with demand. Then came the insanity.
-----
That's not a bygone fad...the same thing happens every year, usually perpetuated by social media, youtube, schools, etc.

Last year it was Hatchemall or however it's spelled.
-----
Assuming he's talking about the smart TV YouTube apps, there isn't an easy way to block the ads.
-----
Yeah TV shows are often created with the intent of selling toys based on the characters, but I fail to see how that's worse than deliberate advertising. Commercials by design exploit our psychological blind spots. A ton of psychology grads go into marketing and advertising because first you learn what kind of signals/messages the brain is most receptive to or swayed by, and then you sell your soul and use that info to trick people's brains into thinking how you want them to. At least with adults we have developed cognitively enough to recognize and block a lot of those tricks. Kids have no such defenses.
-----
Why is it worse? Children have played with toys that idolize their heroes for millennia. Why would it be any different now? Just because it's a TV show, and not a orally passed down story?
-----
That's the thing. They are still watching commercials because the shows ARE the commercial. No more Mr. Rogers, just a 30 minute long corporate plug.
-----
It's really depressing, you can't find a single honest review of anything anymore. 
-----
Thanks! Never thought about that.
-----
That is true. It's better than paying all of the overhead for a big corp.
-----
Are you talking about kids videos on YT or YT Kids?  She watches sing-a-longs, people playing with play-doh and Peppa Pig, yo.  Plus you can block videos you dislike.
-----

Wtf? My 6 & 7 years old nephews don't have cable, and they absolutely love lucky charms, Rice Krispies and kool-aids
-----
It looks exactly the same as I remember.
-----
Kinda off topic, but.... my kids don't see many ads since they watch most stuff offline, or know how to skip youtube ads, but i'm kind of sad they won't get to see the old "I'm a toys'R'us kid" ads from the 70s & 80s.... that was such a Christmas-time highlight for me back then, lol.

A pair of shoes that I wanted in Middle school were re-released in 2015 thanks to Nike releasing the "he got game" retro pack.  

[These shoes specifically](https://www.sneakerfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-nike-air-hawk-flight-retro.jpg)

When I was 14 I had my Grandma at JC Penny and had these on my feet.  She agreed to buy them, for 5 seconds, then changed her mind because they were $80 in 1997.  

I *almost* had them when I was 14... I *do* have them now thanks to the re-release and ebay.  

Best Birthday Ever!!!  Thank you disposable income!! :) 
-----
If you are technologically ~~included~~ inclined, here is another tool you can use:

https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/

Combine that with PLEX, and you can have your own curated, approved video list they can watch. A lot of publishers organize by playlist, so you can snag an entire playlist (dozens of videos) at one time. It takes a bit of work initially, but its worth it. My kids love it.
-----
Hey, those bastards killed Optimus so we'd have to buy new toys.
-----
Not for guns, but we do see them from time to time from the NRA (basically the countries biggest gun manufacturer's lobby group) when they're campaigning about some issue, or when they're advertising in favor of or against one candidate or another.
-----
In case this comes up again, they don't equal those products. They are literally brain tricks to get you to associate whatever feeling the commercial was pushing with those products. Then once the association exists and has been reinforced a dozen times, your brain will feel that having the product will lead to those feelings.
-----
Bidet? Really? Guess I'm living the past. 
-----
Dad, why wont that toilet squirt water into my asshole?
-----
I really really like driving manuals tho, and so do most people who have a thing for cars. Makes you feel attached to the car more. I don't think it will disappear. Just become niched. I am American tho, so it isn't as common here. 
-----
I already don't like door locks
-----
Locking doors? Why would that go away?
-----
Grocery stores? 
-----
I think manual driving will always be around for the car enthusiast
-----
Seriously I had that the other day, applied for a job at a company and they had not a single automatic vehicle. I was a bit floored I've never come across it before. Most places around me tend to have at least a few automatic vehicles to improve the spectrum of who they can hire.

I had on demand and commercial skipping capabilities as a kid. 

Mother fucking VCR recording my shows!
-----
Considering my kids watch YouTube interchangeably with Netflix it already has. Only my oldest watches network TV and that's for football and maybe pitbull and parolies.  They're finger is automatic on the skip add button. 
-----
Yar Har, there be the mast of other options on the horizon, hoist the flag. 
-----
YouTubers have started building the ads into the video itself, which irritates me to no end since AdBlock can't do anything about it.
-----
*children running away in fear*
-----
I would stop watching streamed content. 
-----
That's the day streaming ends in my house.
-----
My kid likes paw patrol stuff. And police cars.

He saw it somewhere else though, not youtube. Kids like toys, there's simply no escaping. It's up to parents to deal with consumerism regardless of commercials.
-----
This year it's Fingerlings.

Fun fact of the day

If you ask people to think of X examples of Y, they are less likely to think that Y is true if listing the examples is more difficult than expected. That being said, if you prime people to think that pulling examples will be difficult, a larger X makes people believe Y is true. This unfounded assumption can be intensified by asking people to list examples while they are 

* simultaneously engaged in other effortful tasks

* when they are happy

* are a knowledgeable novice on X but not a true expert (*cough* reddit hivemind *cough*)

* if you ask them to remember a time when they were powerful immediately before making the list.
-----
So many trash, uninspired background characters especially on Canto Bight. Looked like the designers hit randomize on character creation screen.
-----
That's been the case since at least the early 90's though; hardly a new phenomenon. As long as I can control what they're seeing, I'm pretty kosher with my kid wanting a toy from a show they like.

What I haven't seen (and maybe I just don't watch enough kids shows) are food related kids shows. Netflix isn't pushing cocoa puffs or poptarts in 30 second increments. If those 260 hours that they don't see means that they don't start forming brand attachments to food, I'll fucking take it. 

-----
Even Mr Rogers had merch.  LPs, Books, Daniel Tiger puppets, etc...

Mother Goose Club is my shit. "Dinosaur Stomp" deserves a Grammy tbh
-----
Not OP but I've noticed the same or similar at YT Kids.  My son likes to watch videos of people playing Minecraft. Some are great, they teach him how to make elevators and such. Others teach him to ask his parents to buy the "Lucky Box Mod" or similar. Both are game footage with commentary overlaid but only one is trying to market a product. Does a Red plan help with this type of advertising?
-----
They'll ask for unhealthy stuff sometimes of course, but it's definitely more distributed. There's certainly no allegiance to a particular brand or character anymore.

Bidets are the sign of a civilized society 
-----
How many people really have bidets? I know they are 'widespread' in other countries, but still a pretty niche' thing in the U.S.
-----
The company I work for sells a cheap "portable" bidet that attaches to almost any toilet.

Bidets will be common place and wiping will be *wiped* out
-----
Why would you need a bidet? It feels weird as its usually very cold water and its not like wiping is so dirty. Im wearing white pants at home and dont have any stains on them. 
-----
Shit, you are living in the past. Got a bidet for all three of my toilets. Never can go back
-----
When you have shit on your hand, do you wash your hands? or you simply take paper and rub it? 
-----
Because we use three sea shells now.

Better than my finger slipping through the cheap one ply.

Not sure about trends but I cannot stand grocery shopping of any variety. Even if I go in with a list, grocery stores are the places I go to forget things
-----
I use Seamless/Bite Squad constantly and will likely never order my groceries. I like going and seeing what is available, what looks good, new products I might like. Have been shopping online since the 90s but just don't see grocery shopping being replaced for me. During the summer much of my produce comes from farmer's markets also.

"This video about why airlines charge more for bags is brought to you by Audible. Get your Audible subscription by visiting my referral link in the description below."
-----
Youtube came about because it didn't have any of that crap to begin with. There's lots of room for a service to replace them as they get more and more obnoxious, and they've been shitting on their _content developers_, as well, which is a great way to insure that your service goes flying out the door the exact second a new one comes along.

It is ambiguous how such a service would make money. That's always the hard part to figure out.
-----
I suppose one could build an add-on that relies on crowd sourced reports of all built-in ads in videos. When you get to that exact second in the video, the add-on could skip forward past the ad.

It would take a while to get enough reports to make the add-on useable and it would need a few maintainers to make sure the reports are legit.

It could also have a feature to allow the end user to disable it for certain YouTubers.
-----
...Potatoes?
-----
Probably 
-----
Early 90s? He-man has been doing this for longer. Let's not forget comics being used as advertisements well before that.
-----
More like early 80's. Hell, probably further back.

Almost every single popular show from the 80's was designed to sell toys. He-Man, Thundercats, Ghostbusters (The show), The Centurions, She-Ra, GIJoe, Transfomrers, ALL of them are one gigantic toy commercials.
-----
Oh, I see what you mean. I think she's just too young (2.5yrs) to run into these types of videos.

>Does a Red plan help with this type of advertising?

I don't think it does.  But I would just block them if I saw something like that.

Trick question.

The cleanest one is the one where a prostitute licks the chocolate off of your eyebrow.
-----
Doesn't a bidet just shoot a stream of water? I'm not sure that would do much to get the chocolate out either. I feel like you'd need a wet washcloth to really get it out.
-----
Wipes.
-----
Just bought/installed a bidet that I got from Amazon for $30.  It was life changing.  I'm also now into butt stuff, but that's neither here nor there.

I remain genuinely impressed at the engineering of bidets. How they know the exact vector of the B-hole both excites and surprises me.

Then you have Japanese toilets which are the sign of a whole nother level of civilization.

This is why I hate living in America. You'd be hard pressed to find a bidet in any state that isn't in a private residence.

I have 4 but I only have 3 bathrooms. The new one has a heated seat and blow dry with remote. I have to buy a new elongated toilet and run electrical before I can use it. Once installed, I'll probably never leave the bathroom.
-----
Well ive worked in houses all over georgia there are zero there
-----
Freakin love mine! 
-----
3 bathrooms, 2 have bidets. Best investments!
-----
But you still have to dry your ass, what is the end goal? Using more water or using more paper?
-----
Wait, if you use a bidet, do you not wipe at all? I always assumed that it was a post-wipe cleanse. (Forgive my American ignorance of bidets.)
-----
Speaking for a friend of course, but if you have a hairy butt they do a much better job than paper.

Most people don't enjoy it, and eventually it will come to an end. When it's inevitably cheaper to just warehouse food and ship it to your door, no one's going to Walmart

I had this discussion with my so when i installed ours. some engineer had to figure out the correct angle to shoot for the average human to use it. that means they had to do testing to see what that was.

Less paper over all and a way cleaner ass.  I actually have never tried one myself (but thinking about it).
-----
I let my ass air dry for a minute and then use half as much toilet paper as I usually would.
-----
Not entirely sure as I haven't purchased one yet, but I believe it aids the whole process.  I imagine its Bidet -> Wipe ->Bidet -> Wipe repeated until clean.

90% of everything is shit, but 100% of decisions made due to licensing are. Streaming libraries suck because copyright is a thing. I think it's time we gave corporations a choice: allow anything and everything to be streamed by anyone for the cost of an ASCAP style license, or get no money for it at all.

Actually, I kind of lied there. That's the choice they already have, and they're still choosing no money, because the control and *potential* profits from maintaining a level of control over distribution that they haven't had in reality for at least a decade are worth more to them than actually getting paid.

We're talking they open up as you enter the bathroom and close when you leave. We're talking several kinds of ways it can dispense water straight into your anus, single stream, dual stream, backwards stream, you name it. These are standard features even in public bathrooms.

This the reality. Quite a lot of us shit in the morning after our coffee, and then we're good until tomorrow morning.

Less paper but way more waste water though no?

I have some foul descriptions for this phenomenon, but this one really gets it all in there in just the right amounts.

Not sure.  It probably depends on environmental cost of TP usage per average couric of waste vs the amount of bidet water used that can't be re used down the line (water treatment).

But I am by no means an ass wiping expert, an environment Specialists or a Bidet Pro.

I'm always surprised at how unprotected priceless paintings are in galleries.

I remember seeing the biggest most valuable painting in the state gallery that reached the floor. I watched a child sprint across the room, stumble through the rope in front of the painting and smack their whole body into it with a loud "fwoomp". It didn't tear, but the canvas was a melon-sized depression in the canvas (no hard backing to it apparently)

The whole thing seemed so predictable and yet no one seemed prepared for it, and the security guards looked like it was a total disaster that noone could have ever foreseen.

If I had a gallery there would be a moat in front of the million dollar paintings.
-----
Art is only worth what people are willing to pay for it.  So if people say a painting looks priceless then you can probably just take it.
-----
As an art critic, I would add an Nth item to my list of untouchable paintings.
-----
Well, he's not wrong. 
-----
I'd probably say he'd face "full life Consequences", given the Half-Life of the painting.

Are we sure that Ken M isn't actually Jaden smith ??
-----
I went to the Cleveland Museum of Art and there was an old wooden throne there behind velvet rope, centuries old, I don't remember the details. There was a big sign that said, "DO NOT TOUCH!" I said, "We'll see about that!" I reached out, barely touched it with the tip of my finger and sirens started going off and I heard security guards feet marching towards me from a few rooms over. I turned around and immediately started looking at a painting in another room and put my best "I wonder what that siren is all about" expression on my face. I totally got away with it, I'd like to think it was my excellent acting skills that saved me.
-----
I don't know who is that, but I approve

This happened the first time I ever saw a Van Gogh in person. I had read about his "brush strokes" but the pictures in books don't do it justice at all. I was like "holy fucking shit" and got as close as I could to the thing to really take it in .. then security came over and told me to please back up. There was no rope.

Sometimes you even have to break the glass cut yourself and paint with the blood to understand them!
-----
Galleries do that on purpose. They secretly hope someone would destroy dusty old paintings so they can order new ones.
-----
There's no point in going to a gallery if you can't observe the paintings up close, you might as well look it up online.

When looking at a painting in real life you want to be able to get close for the fine details, to see the individual strokes and to see the paint in three dimensions. 
-----
Aren't some of them just copies and the real ones stored away securely?
-----
They do it like that so they can force people to buy it.
-----
I got kicked out of a museum in Washington DC for accidentally touching a painting. I got excited because there was a dog in it

To be fair, the security guards probably didn't set up the protections around the painting.

Then they shouldn't let anyone under 18, or with a mental age under 18, in. Allowing kids to be a foot away from a million dollar painting is just asking for disaster.
-----
I don't think a transparent box surrounding the painting would obstruct that in any way. Why not something like that?
-----
They would have to indicate that on the placard.

They still do it for paintings that will never be sold. Guernica for example.

I don't know when you were last in le Louvre but since around 2012 (I think) the Mona Lisa is well protected.

Jackson Pollack was an abstract expressionist painter.  [Lavender Mist](http://c8.alamy.com/comp/DD40BH/man-viewing-jackson-pollock-number-1-lavender-mist-smithsonian-national-DD40BH.jpg) is one of his most well known works

[This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_026.jpg/999px-Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_026.jpg) was the painting. The guy who threw acid also cut it with a knife, but what's worse is that total restoration on the painting took *twelve years*.

Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana%C3%AB_(Rembrandt_painting)

You could say that [Pollack paintings](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pollack-autumn-image-ex-all-over-artdiscovery-info1.jpg) look like paintings melted by acid.

He'll go back to bitching about debt when he starts trying to cut programs to pay for the debt he helped create. That has always been Paul Ryan's master plan.
-----
Spends career bitching about Democrats "rushing" bills.

Rushes every bill so much he has to re-vote on some of them because they missed shit.

Morons Are Governing America.
-----
Don't worry- they're about to take a hatchet to the social programs in an attempt to balance this travesty out 
-----
Things change when you have the power 
-----
Not quite the right caption. End part " creates more debt at LAST chance." He's bailing and getting all the cash he can grab.
-----
Thing of it is, he's not being hypocritical. This is just the first shoe to drop. 

In classic Rethuglican logic, what is going to happen next summer when the GOP sees their loss of both the House and Senate as unavoidable, they are going to use this debt that *they* created to **justify a massive gutting of Social Security and Medicaid.**

This aint' over, so get your asses registered and don't let anyone convince you that voting for some third party moron is a viable option. 
-----
Man, I hate the dab so much, but that shit really highlights how fucking dorky and awkward people are when they do it badly.
-----
yeah but that's only like... if you're paying attention
-----
Just wait. The next item on agenda will be to cut all social security programs to "reduce" the burgeoning debt. 
-----
Yeah, but this move cleared HIS right up...
-----
They are creating the deficit/debt so they can use it as an excuse to slash the safety net. 

It's all part of the plan.
-----
this trickle feels warm
-----
Don't forget. They legitimately believe that the tax cuts for corporations and the upper brackets will stimulate the economy enough to cover the cost of the cuts and then some. True believers of the trickle down lie.

10 years ago we used to laugh at the idea of Paul Ryan and politics. He was one of the worst vice presidential candidates since Dan Quayle. Now some idiot thought it good to give him a position of power and we're all supposed to be surprised when he fucks up? He never had any moral integrity

B- poor

and then we told them that the wealth would trickle down.jpeg
-----

-----
This is good debt because it was created by the Republicans who really know how the economy works with their new trickle down system. /s
-----
Don't worry, he'll be concerned about the debt next year and start talking about how we need to cut entitlements. (you know, right after they increased the defense budget by 64 billion dollars, yes the defense budget, the one that already equaled the next 10 countries combined)

This is not funny.

This is one of those rare political posts that folks on both sides can agree on.

Let's be fair about this to Ayn Rand Paul Ryan. Its not just him, every single partisan member of the GOP has done the same. Its just unfortunate that pretty much every single one is such.

he so narcissistic, hes probably doin' a dab so he can sniff his armpits.
-----
To be fair, Paul Ryan voted for the Bush tax cuts and the Bush wars which all added trillions upon trillions to the debt. Like all Republicans, he's just a great conman. Why the media ever cast him as some brilliant numbers guy is beyond me.

When is the last time and administration lowered debt? Asking for a friend
-----
It's all part of why the Republicans.
-----
And didn't he tell that kid not to dab. What a dick.
-----
What about the Hillary administration what added 40 trillion in debt?
-----
Fuck this guy . I hope him and a shit pie both get gunned down . 
-----
I find it ironic that people who don't care about endless debt are now trying to use it as a wedge issue.

I agree that this bill doesn't go far enough, there should be tax cuts AND drastic spending cuts.

But to say you all suddenly care about the national debt suddenly after ignoring the previous administration is just disingenuous.
-----
This is demonstrably innaccurate.

You cannot create debt with a tax cut
-----
Obama added nearly 10 trillion in debt. But now you're concerned. I'll be receiving a tax cut, which will be nice. Please explain your hatred for the tax cuts and how they hurt you?
-----
When Obama raised the national debt by 9 trillion none of you said shit. Now that Trump is president all of you suddenly care  about the national debt 
-----
The Republican way! #hypocrisy 
-----
It's hard blaming republicans for this. I expect a lion to act like a lion, a shark to act like a shark & a Republican to act like a Republican.

 This is something most Americans expected but some still voted for Jill Stein, Gary Johnson & some even voted for Sanders as a write-in. 

-----
I just want to say, thank you, Mr Speaker, for following through with tax cuts for working families. One more thing my family and I are grateful for this holiday season!
-----
Yeah but President Obama added more to the national debt than the 43 presidents before him combined though.

Indeed, this is know as [Starve the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast).

It is a sensationally cynical & underhanded way via which to attain one's policy goals.  

Paul Ryan is a dreadful person & representative, but he's most dangerous because he is effective.  He's perfected that punchable innocent looking face [which SNL lampooned](http://cdn.redalertpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Paul-Ryan-SNL.jpg) to cloud the sociopath underneath and he also is keenly aware of what not to say...i.e. to avoid the batshit Right Wing rhetoric that sinks many other GOP politicians.  

"I'm not a calculated sociopath continually shoveling money to the American plutocracy while gutting programs for the most vulnerable among us, ya see...I'm just a friendly good ol' boy from Janesville Wisconsin working to grow the economy for the average American!"

The sooner he's gone the better, but I'm skeptical it'll be via any other route than his willing retirement into lobbyism.

It's telling what both parties do when they have power. When the Dems held all the power they gave healthcare to the poor. When Republicans got power they gave bags of cash to the oligarchs. Both parties are clearly the same. 
-----
Nothing changed.

He never actually cared about the debt.  Just like the GOP never actually cared about "repeal and replace".  It was just lies to get a bunch of rubes on board.

Ryan believed in cutting the social safety net and rewarding the rich then. He believes in cutting the social safety net and rewarding the rich now.

Everything else was just lies for his voters to get on board.

The parents are on Medicare, their daughter is on Medicaid, and my grandfather has been about to retire for almost four years now, he's going on 67. He'd be absolutely fucked if social security got cut.
-----
> In classic Rethuglican logic, what is going to happen next summer when the GOP sees their loss of both the House and Senate as unavoidable, they are going to use this debt that they created to justify a massive gutting of Social Security and Medicaid.

The issue is that Dems will be in power then when the balloon bursts. The economy will be stagnated (at best) and the Republicans and trumptards will be screaming it's the Dems fault (as the Democrats move to unfuck the GOP policies implemented). The cycle then repeats. 
-----
> don't let anyone convince you that voting for some third party moron is a viable option.

Remember, kids: it's a secret ballot. Therefore, you can go out and tell all your friends you voted for independent candidate Hipster McVeganstein and they legally can't know you voted for Sensible McPragmatistein (D).
-----
This has been their strategy for a frigging *generation*: run up debt for the rich, then use debt to cut social services for everyone else. 

It's amazing that this meme isn't widely known.
-----
That attitude will keep us trapped in a highly ineffective and polarizing two party system forever. I strongly dislike people that tell me I have to vote against my interests. No party platform speaks to what I want so I don't vote for them. Is not that the point? I agree with some conservative points, I agree with some liberal, but I have to be forced to accept that which I do not support because its one or the other? Too bad. We can change this, but it will take effort. I will not just become a party line voter to stop the others. That is not a representative democracy. 
-----
But he is being hypocritical, he just plans on going back to his previous stance and being hypocritical towards this current "temporary" stance in the future. All in all, he's a fuck. 
-----
So when the Democrats get in power they will be spending all of their time cleaning up the mess the Republicans made. During that time the Republicans will blame all the ills this country will be facing on the Dems. By the time the Dems fix everything, the Republicans will gain back their power and the cycle continues. The Democrats need to figure out a way to get back ahead.

If more people voted third party it would be. Fuck the D's slightly less than the R's. They're both controlled by the corporations. It's wasn't the R's that eliminated the single payer, it was the healthcare lobby.

Two theories.

2. A massive conspiracy to supress your ideas, funded by globalist lizard people. 
-----
Conservative comedy doesn't really work. Its ok to poke holes in Democrats, but any jokes about democrat hypocrisy needs to be grounded in reality. Ultimately, comedy is about "punching up" and most conservative policies involve punishing lower classes of people, aka "punching down." Punching down isn't all that funny because it is making light of people's misfortune and exploitation. It makes the person generating the comedy just seem like an asshole.
-----
reddit is pretty left 
-----
Because conservatives choose not to post anything.
-----
Because they're currently hogging all the media time doing hypocritical and unpopular things.

Trumps approval rating is at an all time low (low 30s). The majority of Americans don't favor this tax plan. 

The democrats waited for healthcare votes for a new  republican senator to be seated: the republicans aren't waiting for Doug jones to vote.

The republicans are doing the exact opposite of what they preached just a few years prior.


I mean, there's just a lot of material to work with here. The republicans are losing in Alabama, after barely winnings a presidential race and losing the popular vote, and are trying to ram unpopular items down America's throat.

If trump had decent approval ratings and the republicans changes were popular, you'd see less of this. 

We can bitch about "Reddit's political ideology". But the truth is, 3/10 people agree with what's happening in many areas of politics. Of course you're going to see things skew with popularity.

The Clinton administration, the last few years. Then the Republicans came to power after that, and yet again set new records for the deficit. The past 3 Republican Presidents all set new records for deficits, and Trump is on his way to being the 4th in a row to set a record for deficits. 

Carter, Clinton, and Obama all reduced the deficits they inherited from their Republican predecessors. 
-----
dont' forget her 400 billion stolen children
-----
I think you're missing the point of the thread. Paul Ryan and many modern conservatives have used the deficit as a cudgel to beat back progressive attempts to add any additional spending to our admittedly overburdened government.  This is a principled, understandable position.  To now do a swift 180 degree turn reveals their lack of principle. 


/not a democrat


///not a republican 
-----
Democratic Presidents are the ONLY recent Presidents with a proven record of caring about the deficit. 

The past 3 Republican Presidents all set new records for deficits, and Trump is on his way to being the 4th in a row to set a record for deficits. Each of them inherited a low deficit or a surplus (except for Bush 1 inheriting a high deficit from Reagan), and created a new record deficit by the end of their administration. 

Carter, Clinton, and Obama all reduced the deficits they inherited from their Republican predecessors. Clinton even achieved a surplus!
-----
You reduce revenues while maintaining spending.  That leads to a deficit, which must be paid for by borrowing. An increase in borrowing = increase in debt, no?

I never voted for Obama (I'm libertarian), but you do know why he added trillions in debt right? You do have a rudimentary understanding of the economy right? 

I used to be conservative and I like to believe in the best in you all, but the lack of knowledge that pervades the group disappoints me.
-----
>I'll be receiving a tax cut

And then paying more later. You shouldn't be so short sighted when you're dealing with money. The fact that Obama added 10 trillion obviously doesn't matter to you, because you're okay with adding more.

Obama added nearly $8T. None of you can tell the truth huh?

I'm self employed, my taxes just went up from removal of the SE deduction on the 1040.
-----
I hate the tax cuts because:

A) They hurt small businesses, which me and my friends might want to start one day, by modifying the pass through income portion of taxation

B) Most importantly, I don't like the way they are distributed.  Way too much is concentrated on the upper class.  I've already looked up my cut and, as someone making 60k, it adds ~$70 per biweekly paycheck. In addition to this not being very helpful to me, it isn't enough money per paycheck for me to be okay with whatever service cuts are going to be proposed to cover the difference.

C) The individual cuts expire in 7 years, while the corporate cuts are permanent, which is the opposite of how it should be since these dipasses are supposed to be working for us, not corporations.

*I* support cutting taxes and, not only this bill is absolute shit in the way of cutting taxes on working Americans, but I fail to see how the benefits of this bill will outweigh the cost of it.
-----
As someone who isn't even from the us and completely neutral, the differences in levels of intellect between both sides of the argument is staggering. Just in the way you put across your points and present facts. 
-----
You mean how Bush created billions in debt by waging two unfunded wars and then booting the costs to Obama. Stop trying to make your lies and retardation the truth.
-----
shh you're destroying the narrative
-----
How will you respond when these tax cuts expire in a few years?
-----
Ok, first off: He raised that shit by $983 billion.

Second off: Part of that increase was attributed to him, but was actually from the Bush bail-out that was passed before Obama took office, but was still attributed to his first fiscal year.

Number five (three sir) three: Everyone has always given a shit about the debt. It's how to fix the debt that's the issue here. Medical coverage for individuals who cannot afford it or more money in the pockets of the wealthiest citizens: those seem to be the options that the two sides can't agree which to fund.

Numero four: Obama's administration and congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that added just under $800 billion to the debt over 3 years. So yeah, that shit sucked, but it didn't because that debt was being used to cut taxes, extend unemployment benefits, and fund job-creating public works projects that helped to stimulate the economy after the largest recession since the Great Depression.

As someone who said a lot of shit (I'm still pissed that he put so much fucking money into the military after we "got him" and "ended" the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan) about the deficit under Obama, the fact that we have to fucking sit back and shut-up while the poorest citizens are having their healthcare slashed so the fucking rich can get "what's theirs" is fucking bullshit.

I don't give a fuck if the President is black, white, brown, orange, or a fucking lizard man. If the fucking wealthy are the ones getting the handouts from the government while the poor are the ones paying for it, I'm going to be pissed.

no democrat is suddenly caring about the national debt, democrats have cared about the debt consistently, however they also think things like healthcare take precedence over debt. these are called values.

however, complaining about national debt for 8 years, then immediately never saying another word about it and hiking it up so your rich ass donors can get a little tax cut at the cost of normal americans - that's little bit different, not that i think you have the capacity to understand that though. this proof that republicans value the wealthy over the middle and lower class, and really only cared about the debt as political tool against the democrats who wanted more social programs and higher taxes for the wealthy.
-----
The government is supposed to spend public funds on things that are in the public interest.  Like Medicare and Social Security.  The question you ask about debt is: what did the public get in return?

In this case the answer is 'the public got fucked'.


-----
Could it be that increasing the debt was necessary in order to stimulate the economy and get us out of the recession? Could it also be that interest rates hit an all time low and it would be stupid *not* to take on debt that cheap? No, that can't be it, that would require critical thinking rather than partisan tribalistic bullshit. Let's just blame Obama and praise Trump!
-----
I think most people are just speaking about the hypocrisy of the right.  I do, however, think your statement about debt and the left is true.   The left doesn't mind debt they just prioritize giving the money back to people rather than corporations and rich people that are doing incredibly well.
-----
Are you including all of the Bush era money that was designed to fix our economy from the great recession?  Not really fair.  Trump meanwhile inherits a booming economy and the Republican "deficit Hawks" that threatened to shut our government down multiple times just a few years ago, suddenly see 1.5 Trillion as no big deal.  open your eyes a bit.

When dems had the power the kowtowed to the Republicans and negotiated us out of a single payer system or even a public option while the Republicans constantly bitched at them for even that not being bipartisan enough and "ramming through" a healthcare bill that took 8 months and over 100 hearings to pass. Also starting out with a supermajority and doing absolutly nothing with it, then going on to lose over 1000 seats in the next 8 years.

I don't understand how so many Republicans can be against democratic views. A ton of them are supposedly religious and yet they are afraid to give to the poor because a small percentage might be taking advantage of their generosity?

To be fair.. Dems didn't give healthcare to the poor, they mandated health insurance for everyone.  This gave huge bags of cash to the oligarchs of the health insurance industry.

It was just at least somewhat beneficial to the poor as opposed to the handouts the republicans are giving to oligarchs.

Just like the growth rates they're projecting - they think this will take them to a sustained >4% real GDP growth. No one honestly believes those numbers, and even in the highly unlikely event that they manage to sustain 3% (current is ~2.3%) the majority of that growth is going to occur in big cities in the blue coastal states where there's actually jobs/work and not in some rural coal-mining town in a red fly-over state that's been in steady decline since the 80s.

Since we havent gotten to the spending bill, its a bit unfair to criticize the tax bill on this line of reasoning. Hopefully Republicans can follow this up with sensible cuts to spending

-----
Short sighted? The bill expires in 10 years......If we can keep an annual growth of 3+, we will pay off that 1.5t and then some. I am OK with adding more if it spurs more consistent growth.
-----
The narrative being that the GOP is creating even more debt than Obama? During a period of economic growth and no wars? Yikes

10 years. It's called sun setting. A lot of legislation has this effect and it's a product of senate rules. I would be looking for an extension or enough votes to make it permanent.

> interest rates hit an all time low and it would be stupid not to take on debt that cheap

That's because the interest rates are set by the fed, dipshit. We're literally setting the rate at which we borrow. By your logic the fed should keep interest rates low in perpetuity and we should keep borrowing money because why not it's so cheap(??????). I really can't believe people are retarded enough to upvote this garbage

-----
You know whats cheaper than borrowing debt... Not borrowing debt.  You know whats smarter than borrowing cheap debt? Not borrowing debt.  But your right we have to borrow because you'd be stupid not to. Dumbass. But i guess that requires "critical thinking". Its just common fucking sense.

> negotiated us out of a single payer system or even a public option

One vote in the Senate is what lost us single payer. Blame Joe Lieberman, not the democrats.
-----
"Reaching across the aisle" is great in theory when both sides do it. If only one side will, the reachers are a bunch of suckers. 
-----
The Democrats see the republicans as political opponents, while the republicans see democrats as enemies that must be completely obliterated more so than other enemies of the USA. It has worked so far for them.
-----
I hate to admit it but you're right. 

I hope they are learning. I can't imagine a more stark contrast between the idealistic bi-partisan spirit of cooperation of the dems and the "Fuck you, we gonna get ours" ideology of the republicans. I hope there's a wave in 2018 that carries over to 2020 and when the Dems have control they can undo some damage, move the government to the left where it should be.

I also hope that people will say, both parties **aren't** the same and I'm going to take the one that is 80% workable. None of this ideological puritanism that leads us to trip over our own dicks every time. 
-----
>also starting out with a supermajority

They had a super-majority for barely 2 months.

-----
> When dems had the power

Stop with the re-write of history.  It was mostly one vote that lost single payer.  The Democrats had a super majority for about 70 some days.  The democrats respected democracy and tried to work for a compromise (admittedly, probably not the best decision but at least the Democrats respect our form of government while the Republicans clearly do not).  Finally, why would you blame the candidates for losing elections when the cause seems more related to voter turn out, gerrymandering, low information voting, etc?  

-----
Obama and the Dems in 2008 ran on bipartisanship. They hadn't yet gotten the memo that bipartisanship is dead. Never again. Dems need to run the table in 2018 and 2020 and shove everything through they want/can.

Then what happens when Republicans get back into power and the pendulum swings even further in the other direction again? Our democracy has become unstable. I'd say the voters are to blame but they are acting on the propaganda they are fed. This is a hostile takeover by the wealthy ruling class.
-----
While the leadership is pretty dumb there was no way our blue dog dems were voting for single payer. That is a dumb criticism 
-----
Because at the end of the day a lot of Dems are getting their *real* paychecks from some of the same people as the Republicans.  So while they have to try to represent their electorate and the party lines, they also have to make sure they keep the people with all the money cool with not actually paying their fair share.  Republicans don't have to toe that line.
-----
I'm going to take all my money franchising my name and bet AGAINST the Republican Globetrotters. I feel like the Generals are due!
-----
The Democrats only had a filibuster-proof majority for a couple months. Franken's election got tied up in the courts forever and then Ted Kennedy's cancer hit the tipping point so he left and then died shortly after the ACA vote.

Even when they did have 60 they were at the mercy of Joe "endorsed McCain" Lieberman.
-----
I think they were trying to look more reasonable than the Republicans. Letting the Republicans try shut down the government and filibuster and obstruct. Then the democrats would look reasonable and professional, because people were getting sick of the partisanship even at that point. It clearly didn't work, but we also didn't know about the Russian meddling and propaganda that was going on even at that time as well. 
-----

It needs to be pointed out to people that are glad that they're getting a couple hundred bucks back from this tax bill that their share of the interest on 1.5 Trillion will be a lot more than the couple hundred bucks that they see next year and more even than the accumulation of a couple hundred each year for the next 10 years when their rebate expires. 

It's like taking a second mortgage on your house so you can buy a TV. That TV is gonna be gone long before you pay off that second mortgage and even if it were on sale, you still pay way, way more than you should over the term of that loan.  

That's this republican tax bill in a nutshell.

"When all the old people die, the Republican party will die too!"

- What some old Republican said 50 years ago when he was a young Democrat

The way it works is, when the old people die, new old people take their place. And every year, thousands and thousands of democrats flip to republican as they age. It could be you some day!
-----
Also healthcare was passed with bi-partisan support. Not a single democrat was allowed to even have a meeting with a republican about the tax law. 99% of the bill was written by lobbyists, and not a single human read every page before it passed both houses, exclusively with Republican support.
-----
This tax bill was passed in less than 60 days.

0 to passed in 50 days.
-----
Oh we can blame the whole crew.

Obama himself didn't even "bully-pulpit" single payer.
-----
Wait America was going to have singlepayer???? I never knew this happening. If that one vote happened everything would be better and maybe even some republicans would be happier with their cheaper insurance.
-----
Somehow the  Republicans manage to get their platform through with 52 Senators, but the Democrats couldn't do it with 59 and a half...
-----
Why exactly did Dems need 60 votes? Republicans needed 60 votes for a few things they've done but they either removed the rule or delayed measures (like tax increases on the middle class) to avoid the 60 vote requirement. 
-----
Lieberman killed the public option. Single payer was never on the cards for Obamacare.
-----
It's funny how the media generally only call out Democrats for not being bipartisan enough. When was the last time you saw an article asking the Republicans to reach across the aisle? "Bipartisanship" actually means only one thing: Democrats caving to Republicans in some way that benefits the ultra wealthy.
-----

-----
American politics is a never-ending game of prisoner's dilemma where time after time, Democrats "cooperate" and Republicans "defect."

Give them one opportunity and only one to reasonably negotiate under the old rules. When they bitch and moan, they get exactly the tactics they used this session to undo it all and more.
-----
If there's a huge wave in 2018, Democrats will conclude "Republicans went way too far from the center and got burned for it".

The only thing that'll make the Democrats move hard left is progressives challenging moderate dems in primaries and then going Blue-No-Matter-Who in generals, which is how the far-right took over the Republicans. 

Progressives don't like voting for moderate dems, and I get why, but they need to make dems scared of losing a primary challenge and *only* of losing a primary challenge, the way Republicans do.

It's obvious that the current GOP is completely useless and should be ignored. Just get some goddamn changes in that help 99% of the population and turn off the Fox News.

It all comes down to education.  What they watch now never properly educates them on reality.  They vote the way they do because they truly believe what they have been watching is reality.  

And fox news makes sure to educate them on all other sources being false.

Fox news is the cause of all our issues in this country.  It captures people and brainwashes them.  Most of fox news isn't even news, it is commentary, but because they have news in their channels name people who don't know better think that every segment on that channel is actual news.

From a purely sociopathic view, the GOP killing off the oldest most medically expensive portion of the population is totally consistent with saving tax money for the rich. 

As long as you can brainwash enough younger people into working for the rich for their lives, you can then kill them off before they become too medically expensive.

When the GOP were shouting death panels, they were projecting. It's what you would do if your sole purpose was profit. So it's what they would do.
-----

Yah, it's really sad, actually. I'm a millennial and I am really down with the idea of publicly funded elections.

Remove corporate PACS and regulate "dark money" in politics as much as possible.

If you stop spending so much you dont have as much debt to pay..

They are taking everything they can and setting the hill on fire.

-----
I flipped the other way.  When I realized (years ago) that they truly don't care about the people of this country unless they are rich or corporations.  There is so much money in this country we could provide health care, job training and basic levels of security for families and still have shit tons of cash left.  But we'd rather allow the few to control our govt which controls the people through parties.  

No one should ever have to die or loss everything just because they can't afford health care.  No one should have to be saddled with $70k debt because they want to contribute to society instead of working at McDonald's.  No little girl should ever have to write a letter to Santa asking for food and a blanket.  We were supposed to be leading example to the world but we decided to sell out for a few dollars.
-----
> Also healthcare was passed with bi-partisan support.

well, they *tried* to pass it with bipartisan support. that's why there were so many concessions to the republicans - concessions republicans demanded in the name of due process, and then up and [refused to vote for anyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Legislative_history) because fuck obama and fuck the democrats. seriously, not a single republican in congress voted for the ACA. scroll down to the map of senate and house votes by state and you'll see dem yeses, some blue dog nos, repub nos but not a single, solitary republican that voted yes.
-----
It still blows my mind that conservative pundits keep talking about how the Democrats are refusing to deal on tax reform (implying they're somehow to blame for negative parts of it) while I'm thinking "am I insane, or weren't they not even given the chance to have any input aside from that one token time that Trump invited Pelosi and Schumer to the White House while simultaneously saying he didn't expect any deals to come out of it?"
-----
Ya and no one read it. THe democrats thought maybe people should read the bill before passing it. WHAT A CRAZY IDEA!?
-----
Joe Liberman is also largely the reason why Gore lost. Why the fuck Gore. He picked such subhuman garbage to run his campaign with that even Florida wouldn't vote for.

Obama put his ass on the line the last month of the Healthcare debate. Democrats were ready to abandon ship but Obama decided that this piece of unpopular legislation was worth throwing away his chance at reelection.

Eventually his gamble paid off and he turned an unpopular bill into something he could tout but it did not start like that.

I do wish we had single payer or public options but I am not blaming Obama for not putting up enough of a fight. 
-----
He was trying to lead the country instead of just the Democrats. I guess he underestimated the inhumanity of the Republicans.
-----
Doesn't matter. Let's stop fighting the last war. 
-----
Neither did most of the "progressive activists" complaining about Obama. They voted for him and sat out the fight for 4 years, while the right became active. Next time fight for what you want instead of complaining at those doing the fighting.
-----
dems are always trying to take the moral high ground, do the right thing, win the debate. it doesn't work because they won't accept that they're playing chess with pigeons.
-----
Turns out changing the rules so you only need 51 votes makes things easier...
-----
It's because Republicans have never been the bipartisan ones.  Republicans have never reached across the aisle, and nobody expects them to.  Democrats have spent the last 30 years getting ass blasted by Republicans and the only thing they have to show for it is the reputation of being the party of pussies.

The current Democrats are and have been a bunch of cowards.  To their credit, they have moral fiber.  And guess what? Moral fiber doesn't count for shit.
-----
Hillary was the mascot for Democrats caving to Republicans too. 
-----
That is a possibility. We undo everything Trump did just like he's working to undo what Obama did (remember, they started this). 

The better possible outcome is that people become more politically literate and politically active. Alabama showed us that if people actually engage then Dems win, hence the push on the republican side to impede the average (particularly young and minority) voters.

We can create a working system, it will just require becoming consistently engaged, not just after the crazies elect whatever follows Trump.  

With more engagement and wins from the liberal side, and an acknowledgement that getting 80% of what you want (unlike the tea-party) is a livable solution. I would not fault my representative for binging home 80% of what I want. I don't need 100%, Most of us are better than the tea-party crazies. 

Edit:
-----
Unfortunately probably not, and I say unfortunately because if the Repubs insist on doing it, then the Dems only chance is to do it too.

Your view is actually dangerous because it gives that same impression of 'but both parties are bad!'. No, one party, the GOP, has degraded into an absolute catastrophe that's going to bring the U.S. down with it and then there's the Dems.

Dems have to toughen up and FIGHT, not try to be bipartisan when they're back in power, for 'the sake of it'. No no no. That's only possible when the other side is willing to do it too. The GOP haven't really been willing to work bipartisan since the 20th century, and it's only got worse and worse until we have this.
-----
dems are more than happy to listen to republican *voters*. they can be reasoned with. they can observe when a policy works for them even if the other side came up with it or it goes against their worldview. 

it's republican *politicians* who need to be fired into the sun.
-----
The response to their bitching should be in a calm, quite voice "Donald. Motherfucking. Trump!"

I would not put it past them to ignore all of this though. They have Olympic-level selective outrage. 
-----
Why bother. They have shown that they are 100% hypocrites.
-----
Dude, it's light side vs dark side at this point. Trying for a misguided "balance" just means the dark side is gonna kill everyone again like they always do. They won't change. Ever.
-----
Then we end up with the hard swing to the left. We don't need that. We would then have to deal with a hard swing to the right two years later, wash, rinse, repeat. 

How do we avoid that? We need to learn from the mistakes of the tea-party. Primarying dems who have a 98% democratic voting record will not help in the long run. Am I not understanding what you're saying?
-----
I'm gonna disagree. Becoming a worse version of ourselves cannot be the only way. You know what can kill right-wing ideology? An active aggressive, informed, motivated counter weight. it didn't take something akin to Hitler to beat Hitler. 

Sorry. I'm not on board. 
-----
Dilly Dilly. 
-----
I'm all for it, as long as step one is to get rid of Trump. 

I'd take traditional republicans over trump, traditional democrats over traditional republicans and untethered democrats over traditional democrats. I'm not willing to suffer another Trump term for any ideology. 
-----
Well being fair, they *want* the cost of healthcare to rise, so they can come back next legislative session and renew the attempts to repeal the ACA by saying that premiums are out of control and they need to remove the stifling regulations that are forcing insurance companies to charge so much.
-----
Thanks for adding that /s we almost grabbed some forks

-----
IDK, I like to blame citizens doing their civic duty rather than our shit political process or candidates.

He never should have made it out of the primaries. You seem to be forgetting that. 
-----
Campaign reform, military spending, spying on American citizens without a warrant, nationalized healthcare, corporate tax reform, educational reform including tuition and student loan reform. Dems are no better than Reps on any of these.
-----
That doesn't address my point. Of course spending can add to debt. So can tax cuts. 
-----

So let me know when Trump spends an enormous amount on a healthcare plan that fines people if they don't want shitty coverage and starts rolling out billions of dollars for bailouts but doesn't jail any of the malpractice companies. Then we can talk.

-----
Because the average republican is a despicable racist.
-----
After what happened in Alabama, Paul Ryan facing a primary against a far-right psychopath might not be the worst thing.  
-----
Why does this story persist?  The republicans have control of every branch of government, and you STILL think they're dying out for some reason...  Seriously, the delusion needs to stop or liberalism is dead.  The democrats have really screwed up and they need to figure out what they did wrong and fix it.
-----
I'd love to actually see some legislation "in people's pocket".  It blows me away that there doesn't even exist a healthcare bill until after the election.  

I mean, I get there's some finer points to iron out for passage for the specific group of Senators you need, but broadly, the fact there's no one with a plan ready to go day 1 and then amend is amazing.

Yeah, it does. And the Democrats could have done it just the same as the Republicans. Their bizarre loyalty to Senate procedural rules cost hundreds of thousands of lives, even if you only consider the issue of healthcare. They don't do what it takes to get their platform through, the Republicans do.
-----
Corporate Democrats have been paid to lose, to play the patsy, the Washington Generals to the Republicans Harlem Globetrotters. But thankfully, people are waking up and trying to take back the party.

I want the afterlife to be like a really intense shroom trip. If you lived a decent life you're just tripping, being one with the universe and having silly conversations with your new heaven buds.

But these guys will be huddled in a corner shaking and crying haunted by all the awful selfish shit they've done. They'll have an eternity to themselves to reflect on the effect they had on others. They'll feel the pain they caused, and the hate they created. They'll look back at the fact they had a chance to be a part of the amazing miracle of life, and that they had the power to help but didn't. Instead they abused their power and used other people. They'll be able to see themselves fully and know that they had every chance to change, but now it's too late. 

Or maybe the devil just pokes them in the bum for eternity while we get to watch.

-----
i hope the answer is yes and they suffer with it. That kind of person is self reflective and I dont think these people are. So they will probably live happy and rich and die happy and rich.
-----
The demographic is dying literally. 

The left hasnt energized the base since obama was elected in 2012. The right mobilized, the left is now waking which comes in a HUGE wave. It does each and every time it is woken up. What sucks is dems dont vote when they are not excited. The right always votes, but again they are dying. So the right will change as their core dies.  It isnt a myth stop being ridiculous.

Little bit of both. He was polling poorly before the scandal broke
-----
Still the most conservative state and he won. So it is possible. Especially in states like Florida and pennsylvania where they just need a couple thousand more votes on the left to win.

Sorry but we haven't.

The left has been too apathetic. They haven't been as engaged as they should be. The Virginia and the Alabama elections have shown us what can happen if people care enough to care.

-----hose guys can really help spread the defense and keep them away from the superstar who demands more than one defender. Actually, a better example might be the coach of Curry's team, Steve Kerr, who retired from being a player with the highest 3 point shooting percentage in NBA history after winning 3 championships by spreading the defense away from Michael Jordan and 2 more doing the same thing for Tim Duncan.
-----
Lol problem is they are all really good players.
-----
Similar phenomenon in Football where certain proficient receivers will be in "double coverage" (two defenders covering them) which can leave other parts of the field, or other players more open for passing.
-----
That's basically how LeBron and his teams operate. His drives are so unstoppable in isolation that it's probably a higher percentage play to let him kick out to wide open specialist 3pt shooters.

The Warriors are different though. They run a very fluid offensive system that takes advantage of constant movement off the ball by every player on the team.
-----
I know you're getting bombarded by responses, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/6yls39/gravity/) perfectly displays part of why Curry is so valuable 
-----
It makes the game richer but puts Curry at a higher risk of injury.

Statistically refs are less likely to call out players that foul Curry because of the natural gravity he draws. 

If the refs aren't going to call the fouls than coaches are going to just tell his players to see how much they can get away with in order to stop Curry.

They can't call fouls on him if he's constanly being fouled. 
-----
I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of pro sports including basketball, but that's genuinely interesting strategy to hear about. I feel like the sport is really interesting, but all the extra "floof" kinda turns me off.
-----
That's easy. I always choose to expose myself
-----
*more rich
-----
Its a common aspect of the game. Most teams (college and pro)have someone that is generally better than most the team. They draw help from other defenders and allow other players to drop back or cut in for easier baskets.

Played 13 years of that game. Love it and hate it
-----
For me, Steph's ability to move off the ball and still be involved in the play without touching the ball makes him a better guard than Westbrook and Harden.
-----
Sadly now Argentina plays with a ['Let Messi do it'](http://i.imgur.com/XxLW6nj.jpg) attitude. I mean he's good but come on give him a break. One of the most dysfunctional high-class teams out there imo. 
-----
Messi is so used to it that, Valverde said post match, I can't remember which one, that Messi asked him early in the game where he should put the defender that was man marking him.
-----
Except that almost never happens with Ovechkin, you don't put two guys on him. You block the passing lanes! What's impressive with Ovechkin and the Capitals is that even though every team knows they are looking to pass Ovie at Ovie's office, he still keeps hammering them home. Not winning jack shit but on a scoring level he keeps on getting away with it because of his shot. Rarely ever is he focused in a way Crosby, Tavares, McDavid (star centers) are though. 
-----
This is why wins above replacement is such an interest statistic for any sport.

You can account for many of these overlooked advantages by asking how much a player helps a team win versus an average player off the bench (his replacement).
-----
I mean as soon as anyone touches Lebron they get a foul called, meanwhile Steph is assaulted every fucking game without a whistle. 
-----
I mean usually you think of Michael moving with the ball and causing havoc not moving without the ball.
-----
> And he would still score on you.

But first he would tell the defender what he was about to do. And then do it. And then score.
-----
Yeah not like curry holds pretty much every shooting record or anything 
-----
Even though i don't understand anything about baseball this was an awesome video.
-----
You clearly don't watch very many Cavs games
-----
Well, on any other team, but if you put 5 on Curry they still have 3 or 4 All NBA players who themselves could warrant double teams. Really to beat the Warriors you need to play 12 men on the court.

-----
Great point. 
I'd like to add -

Its like people are expecting Ezeli not to flinch or lose balance after a monster like Westbrook comes barreling into you trying to fight over your screen. 

Calls aren't just given because it was illegal, it's usually given when it gives one side an advantage over the other. Illegal contact and other violations occur all the time. When it is decidedly egregious or gives one an advantage over the other, that is when the refs whistle. 
-----
Wow, had no idea. The way it's written, the screener could go in the same direction, just slower, allowing for a legal screen. That's game-changing (to someone who barely ever watches basketball, to be fair).
-----
You should see the play from last weekend (the one which he made the stupid decision to body-slam the defender after the play was over).  He was held by his jersey on two separate occasions by the defender, then the defender pushed him down so he could make the interception.  Gronk is starting to become Ender from Ender's Game towards the end of his time in Battle School...
-----

And the only high percentage chance to score on them is to switch until Curry is guarding the better offensive player

-----
As somebody who only played barn ball, this gif made me ask why he hadn't been close lined yet. 
-----
Nah you just have to call fouls till the important people are in foul terrible, then they'll stop fouling. It annoys me when great offense can be neutralized with literally the worst possible defense because "lol what, are you going to slow down the game?"

No, the defense is slowing down the game by holding onto the best shooter ever because they can't guard him legally. Give all of them 5 fouls and they'll stop doing it.
-----
bad take. Everyone knows physical play goes up and the playoffs and refs tend to not blow there whistles as much. 

This kind of play would have lasted 1 minute in a season opener, and the thunder would have realized they couldn't get away with it and abandoned it. 

If you legitimately think this is how every possession goes in the regular season, I am sad that some people can watch a basketball game and *not* (or choose) to not see this. 
*seriously* look at this play.
-----
It's hard to swerp anyone, especially the Spurs
-----
bersketbull
-----
> how far behind they are from the warriors.

I don't think they were that far behind the first two finals matchups, but adding Durant to a team that set the regular season win record obviously put the Warriors a step above the Cavs.  Remember that Cavs took the Warriors to 6 games in the first matchup (2015) despite missing Love and Kyrie and then beat the Warriors the year after.
-----
That's a serious narrative you got there, pal
-----
Refs
-----
No one loses on purpose. That's just stupid. 
-----
Bro even Green can sink some sick shots
-----
And they pull up on the fastbreak  which also boosts their % but looks questionable if you dont hit the open 3.
-----
They actually don't set moving screens. That's a very misunderstood rule. You're allowed to set a screen and then continue "blocking" someone as long as you're moving towards the basket. So that thing Draymond does where he sets a screen up top and then basically pushes Curry's defender down into the paint with him when the defender goes under the screen is within the rules and literally every team does it, the warriors just do it the most and to the best results. 
-----
And then you've got the truly talented who just beat their 2 or 3 defenders anyway 
-----
He's also overall just better at basketball than Westbrook
-----
I spent way too long looking thinking it's a gif

-----
You can tell /u/huggybear_ doesn't actually watch Cavs games
-----
Lmao at this being even remotely true.

LeBron is averaging less fta than curry this year.
-----
Slow your roll, player. 1990s NBA defense was basically MMA compared to know. Read up on Detroit Pistions and Bill Lambier. Curry would not score NEARLY as much as he does now, he'd get hammered on every attempt.

No doubt awesome shooter, but 2000's changes in defense allows for more scoring which allows for more fan interest, which allows for more ads.

-----
They have no idea how hard it is to see traveling in real time 
-----
It kind of is though. 

>	The first step occurs when a foot, or both feet, touch the floor after gaining control of the ball.

The key here is that "gaining control of the ball" is never strictly defined. the way the nba has chosen to interpret that is basically when you get both hands on the ball after your final dribble (Unless its an obvious gather with one hand). so your first step doesn't occur until after that point. if you have a foot on the ground while you gather, that isnt your first step. theyre very open with this interpretation, thats just whay the rule is. 


-----
That's exactly how it's written.
-----
I thought I may have mixed something up
-----
Lowering your shoulder doesn't make it a charge or not. And initiating contact actually isn't the deciding factor either. It's about the position the defender has (or likely doesn't have against LeBron and other elite offensive players). The defender needs to get his torso in the path of the ball and establish position there. He can't be moving himself in the way at the same time LeBron (or any ballhandler) is making his way in (even if the ballhandler is leading with his shoulder) - that's a blocking foul on the defense. Getting to that position at the same time is also a blocking foul.

From NBA.com on blocks/charges (from the misunderstood rules page):

>A block/charge foul occurs when a defender tries to get in front of his man to stop him from going in that direction. If he does not get into a legal defensive position and contact occurs, it is a blocking foul. If he gets to a legal position and the offensive player runs into him it is an offensive foul. In both situations, if the contact is marginal, no foul may be called. **To get into a legal position defending against the dribble, the defender needs to get his torso directly in the path and beat him to the spot.** On a drive to the basket, the defender must get to his position before the shooter starts his upward shooting motion. For off ball players, the defender must get into position and allow enough opportunity for the offensive player to stop and/or change direction. **All ties are considered blocks as the defender did not beat him to the spot but arrived at the same time.**


****
Edit: Also, LeBron is currently 2nd in the league in shots in the "restricted area" (the little arc near the basket) with 217 attempts (1st is Giannis with 234). LeBron (43% of his shots come within 3 feet of the basket) is only 14th in the league in total FTA, even behind lead guards who attempt a lot fewer shots at the basket, like James Harden (24.9% of his attempts are within 3ft), Damian Lillard (27.7%), Russell Westbrook (34.2%), Steph Curry (18.2%), Kemba Walker (25.9%), Devin Booker (15.1%). 

Obviously there isn't a 1:1 correlation between getting to the basket and getting free throws (nor should there be), but when you're getting fewer free throws than guys who go to the hoop less than you, then there's a good chance you don't get a lot of calls your way.

Edit2: Here's an even more surprising stat - among players who are on pace for at least 70 games played (so, to eliminate guys who barely played), [**LeBron is 84th** in free throw attempts per field goal attempt.](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/fta-fga?rate=season-totals) There are only 450 total regular roster spots in the NBA (besides two-way players who are somewhat temporary) and many of those 450 wouldn't even qualify for the "on pace for 70 games" aspect of this.

You're thinking of Harrison '0-11 from 3' Barnes.  Dray dropped 32 game 7, definitely wasn't his fault they lost that one.
-----
Wrong. That was undoubtedly Harrison Barnes.
-----
Don't forget offensive juggernaut JaVale McGee.

The peak of Cleveland NBA power just happened to coincide with the friggen Warriors. Which they probably would've beat in 2015 had Love and Kyrie been healthy, did beat in 2016, and then the warriors had to add Durant to get an edge in 17.
-----
Honestly I thought they were much farther behind in finals matchup 2 than 1 even though they wound up winning.
-----
Anyone who pays attention can see the refs shaping the game. Call a bunch of ticky tack fouls on one team early, so when you call a bunch of fouls on the other team late game it ruins their rhythm and prevents teams like the warriors running away from you at the end. Now, at the end of the game the fouls look fairly equal despite the fouls clearly favoring one team.  
-----
Teams don't tank?
-----
Let us not forget the GOAT Swaggy P
-----
Valid points. As a MSU grad, I love watching Draymond play. I'm more talking about the hack jobs from Pachulia

They set a ton of screens, and do it well, but they absolutely push the line. And they should!  The NBA has made it clear they aren't going to be stringent on screens and traveling like the NCAA.  Its more entertaining for viewers to play it loose. They enforce it (relatively) fairly across the league, so go ahead and push the boundaries, its a fair strategy.

As an aside:  Check out this 538 article, its a deep dive into the warriors screens/offense.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-beautiful-chaos-of-the-warriors-offense/


-----
Yupp. You can't move and block someone from running out on the break or whatever, but at the top of the key after the screen you're both just crashing the board. But who's to say when the screen stops and the position battle begins? You're absolutely allowed to shuffle your feet and shove the other guy around down in the paint. So, basically it's a screen then immediately battling for position.

-----
Curry is perfectly capable defender. It's just that he's typically mismatched physically. He gets labelled a liability, but it's really just that he has three all-defensive team caliber teammates, so he's the obvious target. 
-----
They only noticed Barnes was an airball machine late in the series.

Up until the finals he was actually a decent player.
-----
Draymond took 32 3s and made 13

If you take away game 7 which was a anomaly he shot 7/26 which is 27% aka he shot like shit every game except game 7
-----
Game 7 was the apex of letting him open.

They just left him there right in the middle of the line without any passing lanes, and he sat for 5 seconds considering his life choices.
-----
What about game 6?
-----
It was partially his fault for kicking Lebron in the balls and getting suspended. 

I'm glad the Cavs won 1 of the 3. It makes the next one more exciting knowing the Cavs actually have a slim chance at victory. 
-----
WHERE YOU GOIN JAVALE??
-----
McGee is my favorite player on the team at this point, which is crazy to say considering the talent they have across the board. 
-----
Spinning fadeaway midrange jumpers for days. 
-----
It's really nuts out the stars coalesced for those teams. The Warriors bet on Curry and locked him up to one of the biggest bargains in the league. Draymond developed into the 1% outcome for a second round pick and then they crushed the Thunder so thoroughly that it caused the second best player in this generation to join them. This is on top of an owner who is clearly willing to pay out of the ass to keep this roster together but is mitigated by being in a huge, huge market. 

Conversely, the Cavs got Lebron back with Love and Kyrie still on the team. Had a freakish injury happen to Love and had Kyrie playing at like less than 50% in when he did in the finals. It took perhaps the greatest moment in Cleveland sports history to take down the 16 team and then they had Lebron and Kyrie put in two of the best finals performances ever only for the Warriors to just say "nah" and win. 

I'm really curious to see what Lebron's next move is. I imagine he's keeping a close eye on teams with up and coming talent that is a piece like him away from contending. In my bias, I want to say that a place like the Knicks are an interesting landing spot with him alongside Kristaps but I fooled myself into thinking they had a shot to get him in 2010. Never again. 
-----
To win a draft pick and finish last place, yes. But in the NBA Finals, no. 
-----
You forgot to use the sarcasm font. 
-----
Dead center roflol
-----
I can drive in from a non-NBA 3 point line and I'm only 6'2". Harden has done it from NBA 3
-----
Exactly, which furthers the point that the Warriors have such a ridiculous team.
-----
Curry is also a very tenacious rebounder. He sneaks in for a lot of extra boards - definitely above average for his size and position. 
-----
To be fair, that was all Cleveland. Especially with the Cavs winning G5 away and with two 41-point scorers. There was honestly no way they were losing that G6 home game, even if Draymond came back. 
-----
But they do lose on purpose tho right?
-----
Nick Young is shooting a hair under 41% from 3 this season.  No need for sarcasm font, the dude is feasting on open threes in Golden State.
-----
Swaggy is shooting better than Curry from three this year.
-----
How dare you disrespect our lord and savior swaggy p like that.
-----
Contact lmfao
-----
Yeah but saying he out rebounded the Cavs best rebounder without including context is disingenuous. 
-----
I keep saying this to many people. Momentum is a crazy thing in sports and the Cavs had crazy momentum going into game 6! Probably only a LeBron injury would stop them from winning that game. 
-----
yeah but he only gets like 5 minutes each game

-----
Top down, it's a well run team. They're quick to identify anyone who isn't playing their role, and they either drop them or rectify the issue. Zaza sucks, but he does exactly what he's supposed to do most plays. 
-----
KD is a really good argument for player development though.  Because they got a bunch rookie contracts they had enough cap room for 3 top 10 players AND added KD.  It's like the Astros picking up Verlander.

I don't know about four, but, iirc, the late war german tanks were individually amazing, just not the right thing at the time. They were too expensive, too difficult to make, and oil shortages etc made the logistics difficult. So while maybe they were'n worth four, the sentiment still holds: the indiviual tanks were better, but the allies had more than enough tanks to negate the advantage.

No, I think criminals are normal people and knowing that someone makes a lot of money is different than seeing exactly how much is made, how much needs to be paid out and how much you get to keep for yourself.

Haha I can picture it now. Crazy music and monologues followed by an intense scream in agony as they decide they can't go on and have to drop out and continue their normal lives. 

Like all that shit happens than off camera the character just kind of looks around a little embarrased, grabs their bike, and walks home while the dramatic music disappears in the distance with the rest of the racers

This is a very outdated view. The late-war Shermans were also extremely effective fighting machines.

There's a reason the Israelis used up-gunned Shermans decades after the war. The Sherman was a hell of a fighting machine if it was crewed well.

Honestly The Germans had far superior technology, and amazing Commanders. Maybe if they didn't stretch their troops so thin they might have one. We would be playing Wolfenstein IRL.

Their design and were impressive however the continued strategic bombing reduced the quality of the finished products so much so that they were on more even footing than you might otherwise think.

In 1942-43 the allies focused on bombing mines, specifically one in Norway (I forget what it was called, and a quick google search can't help me rn) that was used to create the classic high-hardness rolled steel that was so famous. With the operational loss of the mine, which they never got back up, quality of armor reduced drastically as the steel became more brittle. Brittle steel, when hit with a shell, cracks as opposed to "dinging" and then bouncing projectiles. Additionally, because it's more brittle, even if a projectile doesn't penetrate, they produce an effect known as spalling, where the armor itself fragments on the inside of a tank. Generally in tank combat, any hit that did damage was enough for the crews to bail, including the spalling. 

This, combined with the fact that the factories were often bombed themselves, meant that defective tanks were also accepted for service, as it was better than nothing. 

So while the sentiment that German tanks were individually better might hold for the first production runs of tigers, panthers, and king tigers, by 1944 that no longer held true. Tank combat usually revolved around whomever shot the opponent first, as most guns were powerful enough to penetrate / do enough damage to scare a crew. 

One place this was especially prevalent was on the eastern front, where the Russians using lots of large caliber weapons would do damage to a "higher quality tank" due to the sheer weight of a shell cracking the entire Upper Front Plate. 

Really the sentiment that individual German tanks were better than their allied counterparts is exaggerated from early war tanks that were better, however due to the many factors affecting their production quality it is hard to agree that post-1943 that still held true. And that is before start accounting for the other factors that you recognized.

But the same is true about a standard economic textbook. That is freakonomic's point, that it is very much like a normal business. Should economic textbooks be banned too?
